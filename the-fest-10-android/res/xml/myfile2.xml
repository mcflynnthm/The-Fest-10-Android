<description>
Brooklyn-based trio A Great Big Pile of Leaves originated in 2007 when guitarist/singer Peter Weiland and drummer Tyler Soucy took time from their prior projects to start writing material together. The first six songs came together as the self-released EP The Fiery Works, which the duo put out as a free download on the band's official website. As word spread online, the band's fanbase grew - along with Weiland and Soucy's excitement to get back to recording. Taking advantage of the positive word-of-mouth, A Great Big Pile of Leaves released another self-produced EP - The Fiery Works II - again as a free online download. Within the next year, both digital releases accumulated over 12,000 downloads and the group prepared for a live setting with the addition of bassist Tucker Yaro. After playing several shows and writing a batch of new songs over the next few months, the newfound trio geared up to record the full-length album Have You Seen My Perfrontal Cortex?. Each member took on engineering, production, mixing and mastering duties during the recording process; the record became a full collaboration of each member's respective influences and knowledge. "We don't like to set up any boundaries when writing; we don't consciously come into it with any walls up" says Soucy. "The three of us have a rather eclectic background of musical influences and we like to explore that and have a good time. The only thing we knew coming into this record, is that we were in control and that we wanted to make the best record we could; something we would enjoy from beginning to end with no sense of filler." Since the release of Have You Seen My Prefrontal Cortex? in summer 2010, the group has seen a rapidly growing fanbase as well as praise on influential sites like absolutepunk.net - where the record was reviewed with a 93% approval rating. The momentum continues in the rest of 2010 with a vinyl release of the album and a large-scale fall tour to showcase A Great Big Pile of LeavesÃÆÃâÃâ Ã¢â¬â¢ÃÆÃ¢â¬Â ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã Â¡ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâ Ã¢â¬â¢ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã Â¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Â¦ÃâÃÂ¡ÃÆÃâÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã Â¡ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃâÃâ Ã¢â¬â¢ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã Â¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Â¦ÃâÃÂ¾ÃÆÃâÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã Â¡ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ¢ powerful live set to a wider audience.

<description>
How does one gauge the success of a band pushing the envelope of a genre that receives little to no credit by the mainstream media? In the case of A Wilhelm Scream, the answer is "Who cares?" As a band playing punk rock for over a decade, original members Trevor Reilly, Nuno Pereira and Nick Angelini havenÃ¢â¬â¢t focused on success, image or whatever bandwagon a group can jump on to get their music into the ears of listeners: ItÃ¢â¬â¢s the ideal of music from an honest place, playing to the kids who want to hear more than a simple love song, or want an opinion rammed down their throats. Within this ongoing endeavor, AWS has recruited the talents of Brian Robinson (bass) and Mike Supina (guitar); Two Great-Lakers who have strived to help develop the band into the most musically-diverse lineup theyÃ¢â¬â¢ve had to date, touring all over the World in over 20 countries from Russia to Tasmania. After spending a few months at home developing a follow-up full length album since 2007's Career Suicide (Nitro Rec), AWS is back on the road to deliver punk rock that promises to cater to the kids who are fed up with Ã¢â¬Åeverything elseÃ¢â¬Â.

No Gods, No Masters, No Talent. Philadelphia-San Francisco coed punk shambles, haunted by indiepop and anarchoprop, and a crippling lack of practice. Our hearts, overreaching, and you're invited.

<description>
DC Talk (styled as dc Talk), is a Grammy-winning Christian rock music trio. The group was formed in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1987 by Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait, and Kevin Max Smith. They have released five major studio albums together: DC Talk (1989), Nu Thang (1990), Free at Last (1992), Jesus Freak (1995), and Supernatural (1998). In 2002, the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music called DC Talk "the most popular overtly Christian act of all time." Arms Aloft, on the other hand, are just a bunch of fucking shitheads. 666.

WHAT WE THINK our music is influenced by both high fives and low fives. also, we like bands like none more black, the nerve agents, give up the ghost, trial by fire, the hold steady, samiam and kid dynamite. do the maths. WHAT OTHERS THINK Blasting out of a dirty basement's rehearsal room there comes the straight forward punkrock sound of Austria's very own Astpai. Think of None More Black meets Angus Young meets Dan Yemin, never lacking a sense in melody and sing-a-longs. This heavy rocking Hardcore/Punk sound comes along with both very personal as well as political views and offers some new ideas without just presenting shallow paroles and drained statements. This young band managed to release 2 full length demos between 2002 and 2003 and is now holding their strongest releases to date in hands including their latest full length called "Corruption concealed (under deceptive slogans)," released by Rise or rust records for Austria, Fond of life records for the rest of europe and Jump Start records for the US and a split-cd with UK's ATTACK! VIPERS! out on we heart records for the uk and laserlife records for parts of the european mainland. after three busy years including first euro-tours in 2007, a 5 week tour along the east coast of the usa and a 3 week tour throughout western european parts plus UK in 2008 followed by a total of 7 weeks of touring Europe/UK and a 6 week long tour throughout the entire USA and parts of Canada in 2009 as well as several monthlong tours throughout western europe, greece, eastern europe and russia mixing in 2010 and 2011 ASTPAI just put out a limited 7" called "On Your Own" and their best record to date, the full length album "Heart To Grow", leading the band into further tours and some smaller split-releases with friends bands in 2011. ASTPAI love to be busy and they're busy with what they love. (written by neustadtpunk.net)

<description>
Formed from long-time friends, and D.C. punk veterans, Beasts Of No Nation have taken the long road to their first show in the hometown where they each cut their musical teeth. "We've been doing this band in various stages for seven years, since Mike (Beasts' lead guitarist, also of Darkest Hour) approached Kevin (Beasts' bassist, Majority Rule / Trial By Fire) and I to do it," recalls vocalist / guitarist Jason Yawn (formerly of Trial By Fire). He adds, "We wanted to make sure we did it the right way without allowing our individual obligations get in the way of us creating something we were proud of. We believe in it, and to see it come to fruition is really exciting." The "it" is a quartet that believes in the lawlessness of punk's original intention. Yawn says, "If we are calling it like we see it, and writing stuff that turns us on musically, then we are living that mission." Adding, "Hopefully others out there will connect with what we're doing on some level." That above mentioned "MISSION" can be traced throughout YawnÃ¢â¬â¢s Lyrics. Drummer Andrew Black (Formerly of the Explosion) explains Ã¢â¬ÅIts refreshing seeing a songwriter point out all of the ways in which people have been marginalized to different degrees by their own leadership. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s even more refreshing to feel that injustice and to want to do something about it. That is what Yawn has achieved with his words.Ã¢â¬Â

<description>
Riding high atop the wings of hell with heartfelt punk rock anthems big in sing-alongs and steeped in old school rock and roll, Blacklist Royals have played hundreds of shows over the last four years including runs on the entire Vans Warped Tour; SXSW; The Fest; Harvest Of Hope; stints on the road with legendary bands like Pennywise, The Queers, Circle Jerks, and Less Than Jake; and countless sweaty clubs and basements across the US and Canada. Their blend of styles and strong DIY ethic has generated praise from cornerstones in the punk community like Maximum Rock And Roll and Alternative Press, as well as garnering the attention of media giants like the LA Times and Fuse TV. Overcoming everything from member changes to terminal illness within the band, their die hard spirit and musical roots have helped the guys create a sound and live show all their own. Signed to Paper And Plastick Records (Vinnie from Less Than Jake/Fueled By Ramen's new label) in the US and Gunner Records in Europe (home to bands like Fake Problems, Gaslight Anthem, and Frank Turner), expect to see the guys on the road constantly, cruising through towns big and small, driving fast, living hard, and playing their fucking hearts out.

<description>
Having spent his musical adolescence in Pennsylvania playing guitar and singing in Plow United, Brian McGee is not the most natural figurehead for a movement of new Americana rock/punk. But after living in Western North Carolina for the last ten years and absorbing the sounds and culture of the region, McGee has milled a new angle into his songwriting palette and taken to fusing his punk rock heritage to raw country sounds. Once it became obvious to him that Iggy Pop and The Carter Family played the same three chords, McGee was off and running. He has recently moved back to the northeast in time to play a reunion show with Plow United at Riot Fest East this September.

Catchy as hell indie pop-punk 3 piece with girl and boy vocals from Bristol U.K. Sounds like they're stuck in the 90's, or at least the bits they liked... Get your WOAHS out.

<description>
2-piece instrumental rock from the Mitten State: "It's just all cutting edge instrumental, all the time. That makes for a fascinating listen, but not because you haven't heard such a sound done before. You probably have, just never with quite the amount of precision or abnormality as it's done here. A word to all the fans of the avant-garde out there: Charles the Osprey could be your new favorite band." - Matthew Tsai (Absolute Punk)

<description>
Circle Takes the Square is currently in the studio finishing the follow up record to 2004's As the Roots Undo. Over great distances and with sporadic, but intense writing sessions, we completed Decompositions and began recording on 1/1/11. <br />
 <br />
 Our newest musical offerings are Explorations in Decay- mapping the "window areas" of existence, where the predictable becomes defiant, and all that we "know" begins to break down. Circle Takes The Square draws inspiration from dissident mythologies, handed down in slurred whispers from one dying counter-culture to the next. We garner influence from the soft-spoken rumors of age-old esoteric traditions, of informal rituals associated with confronting the shadow, abandoning the persona, and an eventual re-interpretation of that which civilizations and our bound-up senses have presumptuously defined for us as "Truth". Simply put, we are a punk rock band with reverence for the Mystery.

The guys in Cletus haven't played Gainesville since their frequent appearances at The Hardback Cafe back when they were constantly touring their brand of Descendents-like 90's pop punk. Frontman Johnny Puke is long a friend of the Fest and this year he finally gets to play with his band, known for their three full lengths on Chicago's Johann's Face Records as well as a slew of comps and 7's on labels like Mutant Pop and Lookout! Cletus rarely tour these days and this is their first live appearance since Insub Fest 2008 in Baltimore.

<description>
Gainesville's favorite caffeinated duo Coffee Project have just finished tracking their self-produced new album entitled "Moved On," slated for a late spring release via Paper + Plastick. Coffee Project is the brainchild of good friends Buddy Schaub (Less Than Jake) and Jake Crown (Rehasher). The band tracked eleven songs at Schaub's home studio and is currently mixing at Roger Lima (Less Than Jake/Rehasher) Moat House Studios. Buddy had this to say about wrapping up the final days of writing and self-recording "Moved On": "Jake and I started working on this record back in October of last year, and 75-100 pots of coffee later, we finished recording our last vocal track just yesterday. We tossed around the idea of going to a studio and having someone else turn the knobs this time around, but thankfully we decided to stick to our guns and record everything ourselves in my house. I think Jake and I really took advantage of that while working on this record; we were able to try out some crazy ideas that may have just gotten tossed out if we had been working under the gun." "We really are fortunate to live in a town such as Gainesville that has so many talented musicians. As with the last record, we asked some of our friends to come over and hang out for the afternoon and would bounce ideas around with them. Kim Helm (Whiskey and Co.) came over a couple of times and threw down some sweet harmonies on a few of the songs. Jon Gaunt, who plays fiddle with Chuck Ragan, also laid down some backing bow work on the previously released 'Big Trouble In Little Gainesville,' which we decided to re-record for this full length, and I think adding his part to the song really took it to a new level. We stole our friend Michael Claytor, who plays in a virtual cornucopia of bands around town, for a couple of hours one day to rip through one of our songs on banjo. By his second time through the song he was nailing it like he'd been practicing for a month solid. He is such a talented guy, has a great voice, and is really amazing by himself with just an acoustic guitar." Moved On is the follow-up to their previously released 10" EP Easy Does It and their digital-only EP Pickle, both released by Paper + Plastick.

Coliseum formed in November of 2003 and has since toured and recorded with relentless abandon for nearly a decade. Their first, self-titled album, was released on Level Plane Records in 2004, followed by the Goddamage EP in 2005, and their second album No Salvation on Relapse Records in 2007. The band has been on countless tours in North America, Europe, Australia and Japan, with Rise Against, Converge, High On Fire, Mono, Napalm Death, Baroness, Russian Circles, Torche, Integrity, and many others. Coliseum joined the Temporary Residence Limited roster in 2010 with the release of their third long-player, House With A Curse, followed by a deluxe reissue of their Goddamage EP soon after. In 2011 Coliseum released a split 7" with legendary indie rockers Superchunk and a live split LP/CD with former tour mates Burning Love, all while continuing their tireless touring schedule.

<description>
âCreepoid is another one of those buzz-worthy local bands crawling out from basements of homes/makeshift practice spaces/recording studios lately in Philly. On their debut EP Yellow Life Giver, they use a reel-to-reel tape machine circa â56 to help document their evolution. Yes, they are another lo-fi act flooding the indie music landscape, but Creepoidâs raw, gritty production perfectly compliments these four eerily engaging tracks. They open the album with âRotten Toothâ which is filled with the spirit of Kurt Cobain and that 90âs Grunge angst all heroined out. In âPink Tag Saleâ, youâll experience a dreamy Left Coast vibe that feels like it was written around a campfire in the lonely desert night. Itâs in that Mazzy Star vein that haunts our subconscious. Youâll also find Creepoid putting on their dreary Brit-pop/post punk masks in âSee-Throughâ before closing with their experiment in minimalism âMagic Drumâ. The four-song EP is a tease. You canât help but wonder what these guys and gal have in store for us next.â â Q.D. Tran From : The Deli Magazine

<description>
For years, the record industries have inserted subliminal messages into music so that they can turn teenagers into braindead zombies who do nothing but buy, buy, buy. And whenever the musician or band finds out the truth, the record company silences them to keep the truth from coming out. When the hot boy band DuJour discovers this, their manager, Wyatt Frame, under his evil, corrupt boss, Fiona, has the plane they are flying in crashed and him looking for a new band to use for their evil schemes. Enter Josie, the ditzy Melody, and the tough Valerie, from Josie and the Pussycats, a small band who wants to make it to the big top. When they are discovered by Wyatt, they give in and become big rock stars. But will they find out that they are just pawns for the record industry or will fame take them over?

<description>
Starting as a three-piece band in Columbus, Ohio; Defiance, Ohio has evolved into a family of musicians spread across three cities that has shared nearly a decade of performing and recording together.<br />
 <br />
 Drawing on the diverse and changing musical interests and practices of its members, the band is unique in the way songwriting has been shared between almost all of the members. While the members strive to incorporate musical influences with a fluidity that contradicts the rigidity of genre, the bandÃ¢â¬â¢s practice remains grounded in the culture of do-it-yourself punk and other vibrant, participatory communities. Lyrically, Defiance, OhioÃ¢â¬â¢s songs often reflect the personal resonance of navigating larger social dynamics like geography, race, violence, sexual orientation and mental health.<br />
 <br />
 To date, Defiance, Ohio has released four full-length recordings as well as split-EPs and compilation tracks through self-release and a number of independent labels. During the summer of 2011, Defiance, Ohio is Elizabeth Gibbs, Geoff Hing, Theo Hilton, Will Staler and Ryan<br />
 Woods.

Out of the sewers of Greece's dirty capital, buried underneath the Acropolis, breathes lives and exists this 4 piece ticking time bomb in a basement situated in the dodgiest street in Athens. Formed in early 2008 by fellow individuals colliding with each other to create music made with passion, for those willing to put their fists up and sing their hearts out in an effort to not to be silenced by the sound of a city drowning in its own dirty waters. Have released so far two 7'' EP's,"In Desperate Times" (2009) and With My Bear Hands" (2010). They have 2 upcoming 7â splits with UNFUN (Canada) and In-Sane (Slovenia), both scheduled to be out this Fall. The band toured all around Greece and Europe several times playing in the dirtiest squats, basements, garages, and bars. Holding strong diy ethics, the band records themselves alone, silk screen and design their own merch, and book their own tours. The band is grateful to be a part of this diy movement and soon enough will be around to share their music, thoughts, and rebel yells in a town near you. "when rain is pouring down on our cities made of steel, we're bound to rust away." D.E. For tour reports, news and stuff Visit our blog at http://tonightwehitrockbottom.blogspot.com

<description>
Die Hoffnung established itself as an occasionally interesting âpunk-rockâ band in the early twenty-first century. Punk-rock, invented by the Koch brothers in the late 1970s in reaction to the American ârevolutionaryâ threats of the 1960s, was intended to divert anti-establishment sentiment and energy away from effective action and into localized, marginalized âcapsulesâ of feckless, disorganized noise and harmless vituperation. It was ingeniously manufactured to fail, created on a contradiction, from its inception rendered meaningless, blithe railings against the consumerist system within which it was conceived, on which it depends to thrive. As millions of intelligent, creative, compassionate young Americans devoted themselves utterly to their personal tune-craft (Saith the Ayn Rand, âYour allegiance is but to yourself and your private interests and fuck everybody else.â), the Koch brothers bought everything and will sell it to you for the constitutionally mandated price, which is whatever you have, and you will buy it because you donât know how to do anything else. I come from the future. Our scientists discovered that money is the source of all cancer, but the uncovered Tweets of their boners and the accused rapes and the myriad disclosed perversions brought discredit upon them. (They were framed and entrapped, alas!) We have learned to digest roaches and asphalt because thatâs about all that remains, besides money, for which we savagely scrabble and grope, in accordance with the new scripture. Wealth is grace. God is a moneylender. Profit is pious; heresy is free. Everything is for sale. Almost everything. Come close while I whisper. We have invented a new music. The subtle rhythm of asphalt stomping through our guts, the squeaks of the cockroach as itâs chewed. Knocking stone and tiny shrieks of split chitin. Strange, complicated songs, but pleasantly resonant within, resonating from, our own selves, and free. Some nights, in caves, in foxholes, we play for each other, quietly for gosh sake, almost inaudibly. To the frustration of The Government, Inc., unable as yet to flush us. But there is a bureaucrat, a sympathizer, different from the other bureaucrats in humor and dress, an admirer of my work, says Iâm unique, says Iâm languishing underground. He has his own song. It sounds like this: âI love you. You shall not want. Everyone has to make a living somehow. You are nobody until somebody buys you. Be bought and be born again and again and again.â It has an infectious melody.

How ugly is Dikembeâs Halloween mask? Itâs so ugly that it almost scared her little brother to death. So terrifying that even her friends are freaked out by it. Itâs the best Halloween mask ever! Itâs everything Dikembe hoped it would be. And more. Maybe too much more. Because Halloween is almost over. And Dikembe is still wearing that special maskâ¦

A review of our self titled 7" released earlier this year: This is apparently available on a 7-inch... but I got a special "press version" on a CD that had a unicorn on it. Really.... a unicorn. The CD came in overdone DIY packaging with lots of friendly little notes from the band and basic info stuffed inside. How nice. But isn't DIY supposed to be cheaper? Has some unknown art of making something look half assed sprung up in the hipster underground? The fact is, I would really like to kill Douglas Shields and the X Factors. Ten years ago, before everyone started swearing off the word "EMO," DSXF would have been billed as an "emo" band. Only then they would have been current; now they are just one of thousands presenting punk rock with absolutely no aggression and balls. DSFX can be equated to some whiney 20 year old whiney prick crying to world about how he wished he had done something important in his teenage years instead of taking beatings from his closet fag father for not making the football team. "Blah blah blah I think about stuff too much and canât get laid" should be the title of this record. We just released a digital EP called "Blah blah blah I think about stuff too much and can't get laid" which you can check out for free at dsxf.bandcamp.com. THANKS JERSEY BEAT!

<description>
Elway is an American metal band from Huntington Park, California. Formed in 1981, the group was founded by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. Elway rose to fame with their 1986 release, Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the "Big Four" thrash metal acts, along with Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Elway's musical traits involve fast tremolo picking, atonal guitar solos, double bass drumming, and shouting vocals. Elway's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, Satanism, religion and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the public. Since Elway's debut album in 1983, Elway has released two live albums, one box set, six videos, two extended plays, and eleven studio albums, four of which have received gold certification in the United States. Elway has received five Grammy nominations, winning two of them; one in 2007 for the song "Eyes of the Insane", and one in 2008 for the song "Final Six". Elway has played music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest. Also, none of that is true.

<description>
A couple of us were standing around the coffee pot the other day talking about the seemingly recent resurgence in popularity of all the old 90's college rock bands. We couldn't decide whether these bands had actually remained popular throughout the later 90's and early 00's and maybe we were just dialed into the wrong channels at the time, or whether they had actually disappeared over the years and are experiencing a legitimate comeback. It might be a geographic phenomenon as well, but over the last few years there's been a score of new East Coast bands that are unabashedly flying the flags of bands like Archers of Loaf, Superchunk, Gin Blossoms, Pavement, and Guided by Voices. While these bands were THE college radio titans of the early- and mid-90's, by the end of the decade they'd all either broken up and begun to fade or, far worse, released a handful of painfully mediocre albums and slipped into the "man, their old stuff was way better"â rock genre. While Failures' Union have been kicking around for a bit longer than some of their contemporaries, they share many of the same traits. All three members grew up on the aforementioned wave of indie rock while maintaining strong ties to the do-it-yourself ethic and independent attitude engineered by the hardcore pioneers of the early 80's. As a result, they stand in small company as one of the mellower bands currently traversing the underground highways. "In What Way," spans their capabilities to the fullest, from the brighter upbeat rockers to the somber mid-tempo affairs, all carried by Tony's rich baritone voice. While the cleaner tones, fuzzed-out leads, and touches of piano and glockenspiel may alienate their label's black shirt and Converse-sporting fans, listeners with more eclectic tastes will find themselves surprised by the eloquent melodies and nostalgic atmosphere that surrounds the songs found within. The Story: Tony played in a band in college, loved it, and then got hitched in 2000 and announced his retirement from music. After being married alive for a few years, he got divorced in 2004 and started writing songs at home with drum machine back-up. He took the demo to some shows and started asking around about interested drummers. Longtime friend Tim volunteered, and suggested his brother Jason for bass duties. Given their shared love of all the great 90's college rock bands, the three fit together like peas in a pod and set about writing and playing shows. They decided on the moniker "Failures' Union," with the appropriately placed apostrophe denoting the empowerment found in kindred hopeless souls. After the "You Know Who" EP, Tim left the band and the future looked grim. Tony was a dentist at the time and Eric was a patient of his, and the two got to discussing music during a cleaning one day. It was decided that he would fill in long enough to release an album and then they'd call it quits. Things ended up going well and they decided to remain a group. They did a couple of tours with bands composed of the children of celebrities. They even released a split 7" with one such band, Cheap Girls. Eventually they found a home at Paper and Plastick and put out the album "In What Way." Shortly after it's release Eric moved to second guitar and his child prodigy brother Blake took over the drumming position. It's been over half a decade since their inception and they are playing with a renewed vigor still burning as brightly as it did when they began.

Fellow Project have been a band for 10+ years. Based out of Long Island, NY they feature ex-members of Bridge and Tunnel, On The Might of Princes and Yes Sensei. "Somewhere between angular post-punk and straight up punk rock lays Fellow Project...the band's songs feature jangly riffs, staggered tempos, monumental buildups and good old upbeat sing-alongs with male and female dueling vocals. They sound novel and familiar all at the same time."

<description>
Former Thieves have been a band characterized by their hard work and grueling tour regimens in their seemingly short life span. But, that's about to change with their debut full length on No Sleep Records. Coming from the barren and simple fields of Iowa, Former Thieves have created a record that personifies the feelings and emotions of coming from nothing and fighting the entire way to what they have created. "The Language That We Speak" takes the listener through a thorough commentary on the frustration of Midwestern life. Articulate, sharp, and sincerely pissed. Recorded December 1st through 10th 2010 at The Red Room in Seattle, WA with Chris Common (Mastodon, The Sword) at the helm, No Sleep Records looks to release "The Language That We Speak" on Tuesday April 19th 2011. The record will be released on CD, vinyl, and digital formats.

We're a 7 piece Doo Wop group from Minneapolis, MN. As Doo Wop as one can be with God Damn in the name anyway. 3 fellas, four ladies, and a whole lotta sha doo doo wah wahs. Sometimes we wear poofy dresses because we think it's fun. You don't have to wear one, but it couldn't hurt. Last year at Fest! we got to play Boca Fiesta at capacity and throw fireworks at each other. We thought that was fun, so we're happy to do it again. We don't record much, and we don't tour much, we don't play much either, but that just means when we do our good time power packs are on full. If that's the kind of thing you're into, we can probably hang. Oh, and if you happened to have found my phone last year, I'd love to have it back. Sha doo be doo.

<description>
Been a "band" since Oct. 2000. Todd Taylor from Razorcake wrote this back in 2005. Best thing to a Bio that we've got: Grabass is a friendship. Grabass is a proud product of a town they love. Grabass drive a stubby van and will drink you legless if they come through your town. Grabass is a story of a bunch of people having shitty jobs, getting together, and making a band. Three dudes, serious about their ridiculousness, found each other in Gainesville, a passion-filled, non-plastic ding dong swamp town in Florida, where having a good time is often a full time job. Think of Gainesville as the unheralded fourth member of the band. Itâs relatively easy to record there, easy to find people to make music with, and easy to get shows. Itâs cheap. A hotbed. Grabass got together, circa 2000. Charleston, WV native Will Thomas (aka Dub T) cleaned out the fish tanks at No Idea. This former Chinese food deliverer and current line cook had been a drummer for the Beltones, the Lexingtons, and the Habituals. He had songs in his head and heâd put them to paper. He wanted to get them out of his head and play them live. He wanted a band that was direct. No bullshittinâ, full of humility and passion. Enter Replay Dave and Peej. Replay is a dependable, and arrestable, bassist. Heâs also the scribe of the zine Coffeebreath, graduate from DeLand High School in 1994, No Idea task completer, a proud holder of a degree in philosophy, and has been dressing up as a convincing leprechaun for over a decade. Replay and Will had played together in the Lexingtons. Add Peej, a Santa Fe Community College graduate with a degree in computer programming (and current No Idea interwebdude and technological spearhead), and an effortless and extremely gifted guitar player with privileges to a badass summer home of a famous rock star relative. Bang! Youâve got yourself a band. They practiced for a year in Peejâs home. Much liquor was slaughtered in the name of rockânâroll. All three are compulsive gamblers, jubilant jai alai enthusiasts (with matching tattoos, cestas raised high and proudly), and vigilant hometown gentlemen. By 2002, they had a split record out with Billy Reese Peters (a band that shares Will and Peej) and they toured. People clapped after their sets and purchased their records. Late 2003 saw the release of their triumphant first record, âThe Greatest Story Ever Hulaâdâ. There was much rejoicing and much touring. Grabass toured the U.S. with friends Against Me! and Lucero, then doubled back to drink every east coast town dry with Dillinger Four. The beginning of 2004 saw Dave become a semi-pro gambler. He won two months rent and âa really sweet sleeping bag.â The guys toured Europe for six weeks in the summer and Will quipped, âI guess we could say weâre better than every other band in the world, but then weâd really sound like assholes.â 2005 brings us to their newest full-length offering, âAsk Mark Twainâ, and a full US tour with their partners in party crime the Soviettes (Fat Wreck Chords). The combo will also be playing shows with the Tim Version, J Church, Big Business, Toys That Kill, Japanther, and the Arrivals. What does that translate into? It translates to fuckinâ high fives.

<description>
Since 2007, Greenland is Melting have put their own spin on folk, bluegrass, punk; penning an original sound with straightforward, hometown lyrics. Hailing out of Gainesville, Karl, Shaun, and Will have always approached their music with a drive and direction that perpetuates real, honest experiences put into porch-driven sing-along's. This especially rang true with their October 2008 debut self-release, "The Measure of A Man's Worth." Recorded in various bedrooms and bathrooms, these DIY recordings set some serious groundwork for the band as they honed their aesthetic and took their songs to the road. With extensive southeast touring under their belts, the trio not only found themselves with countless stories and experiences that paved the way for their new full-length, but an ever growing audience to woo with their earnest fervor and alluring three-part harmonies. Armed with banjos, harmonicas, a suitcase bass drum, and a slew of other instruments in tow, the Greenland boys break the typecast we all know as the "Gainesville sound" and bring a breath of fresh, folk-induced air to the masses. With an already large following due to their heartfelt performances and relentless work ethic, Greenland is Melting is more than ready to bring their sound to your back porch, kitchen, or basement. Their new full-length, is appropriately titled "Our Hearts Are Gold, Our Grass is Blue," and is available now through Paper + Plastick Records.

The guitar feedback swells as bodies pack into a cold garage in Chinatown to catch a glimpse of Toronto's newest and dirtiest rock band, Greys. In spite of the February chill, people crowd the quartet as they rip into a set of throat-searing, fist-raising anthems that mix muscular riffage with atonal discordance in a style that wouldn't be out of place on a Sub Pop or Touch and Go sampler from 1991. Put it this way: If Fugazi suddenly displayed a penchant for stoner rock riffs; if Duane Denison jammed with John Reis; if Nirvana never released Nevermind; if the nineties never ended - this is the alternate universe in which Greys exist. They're no throwback band, however. Far from it. They simply display the raw, aggressive, yet artful and progressive traits bands haven't shown off in over a decade - especially in their hometown. They play very, very loud rock music, and that's enough cause for applause. The lack of likeminded artists in their city is what spawned Greys in the summer of 2010, as the four young men sought to fill this void themselves with serrated guitars, pounding drums, guttural basslines and pissed off vocals. This frustration manifests itself at their energetic live shows, impressing fans of acts as disparate as Mike Watt, Burning Love, Marnie Stern and Tera Melos, plus those of local heavyweights Teenage Kicks and Indian Handcrafts, in packed venues all over Toronto and the rest of Southern Ontario - and this is all before their debut EP, Ultra Sorta, gets released on April 26th. The EP serves as the perfect introduction to Greys' sound. With five tracks clocking in at just over fifteen minutes, it is at once visceral, caustic, blunt, yet somehow laden with hooks; melodic landmines buried beneath waves of feedback and gargantuan guitar licks. The packaging itself represents the band's DIY attitude - pressed on a limited run of 10" coloured vinyl, with hand-printed and hand-numbered sleeves, and released on grassroots upstart label, Concession Records. So when you see throngs of devoted fans surrounding Greys in similarly unorthodox venues, know that the band is offering their audience something more than just shelter from the cold - they provide an alternative to the hip dance parties and forgettable "indie rock" bands taking up space in their city's venues. They're giving them more than a soundtrack for a debauched evening out with the cool kids. They're giving them a breath of fresh air. They're giving them rock n' roll.

<description>
Formed from the ashes of now defunct melodic death-metal band Light This City, Heartsounds consists of founding members Laura Nichol (guitars/vocals) and Ben Murray (guitars/vocals) who after growing tired of banging heads decided to return to their true love - punk rock. "Laura and I have always been fans of punk rock from before we even started listening to heavy metal," says Murray. "From the time we were 13 years old our favorite bands have been Bad Religion, Strung Out, Propagandhi, etc. We had never stopped enjoying and following punk rock, so when we were tired of playing melodic death-metal it was obvious what direction we wanted to strive for musically. The passion and emotion that we can express through punk rock is definitely unlike any other genre of music, and we are having the time of our lives so far!" The best friend duo spent the beginning of 2009 writing and entered the studio that summer with former Light This City producer Zack Ohren to record their debut album. "Until We Surrender" is a heart-pounding throwback to 90's punk era, focused on the faster and more technical aspects of its style with elements of pop-punk and indie sensibilities all mixed in together. Murray and Nichol's back and forth vocals complement each other immensely, while their warm rhythmic riffs intertwine for a fresh take on the classic punk sound. Murray puts it best in his lyric "I've found my true calling, and it's never sounded so fucking good." After a year and a half of playing live in support of their debut offering, Heartsounds is back in the studio finishing up their second full length release, slated for a June release through Epitaph Records.

Hot Water Music Biography Hot Water Music may have never had a hit single or seen their mugs plastered all over MTV, but over the years the act have done something far more impressive: They've achieved a lasting relevance that most of the aforementioned acts could only dream of. Since forming in the early nineties in Gainesville, Florida, Hot Water Music have released seven full-length albums, countless singles and toured with everyone from Flogging Molly to Coheed And Cambria along the way but all of those stats are overshadowed by the fact that for nearly two decades this four-piece have stayed true to their roots, themselves and their music in the face of countless fads and generational shifts. Formed out of the ashes of two other short-lived punk acts, Hot Water Music was born when singer/guitarist Chris Wollard, bassist Jason Black and drummer George Rebelo joined forces with guitarist/vocalist Chuck Ragan in 1993 and since then the four-piece have never looked back (aside from a short-lived break-up in 1996 that was the catalyst for the band's classic live recording Live At The Hardback). By combining elements of punk rock, jazz and post-hardcore, the band pioneered a unique blend of music that is at the core of their still-celebrated nineties output including 1997's Forever And Counting and 1998's Fuel For The Hate Game. Hot Water Music decided to call it quits in 2006 with Ragan and Wollard pursuing their respective solo careers while Black joined Senses Fail, however after two years apart (which featured Wollard, Black and Rebelo coming together to record and tour with their new band the Draft), the members once again reconvened to start performing live to the delight of both long-term fans as well as those who had learned about the band through their more melodic but equally celebrated turn-of-the-millennium releases such as A Flight And A Crash and Caution, both of which were released on the esteemed indie label Epitaph Records. "We had talked about [the reunion] for a while and we hit a point where it seemed like there wasn't a good reason not to do it," Black explains. "We decided to set up that first weekend of shows and they went way better than we thought they would, so we just kind of kept doing shows and getting together whenever we could," he continues, adding that ironically Hot Water Music seem bigger these days then when they were touring full-time on their last studio album. Earlier this year Hot Water Music toured Australia and released a split 7-inch with their lifelong friends in the Bouncing Souls that saw both acts covering each other's songs, but fans are still holding out for the first HWM album since 2004's The New What Next. "The rough game plan is we're going to try to do a new 7-inch this summer and use that as a stepping stone to getting the record together," Black explains, adding that the fact that all four of the band members live in different cities nowadays has been one of the factors why it has taken so long for the band to come up with new material. "We are writing through the Internet at this point and making headway and I think everyone is really excited with what we're coming up with despite the fact that everyone is also busy with other projects," Black explains before adding, "I would be surprised if we didn't come out with a new record next year." Despite the fact that musical trends and genres have changed greatly since the band started out, Hot Water Music's relevance in the punk community has always been evident from their early shows in DIY spaces and basements to the fact that the band's former tourmates Thrice did a complete set of HWM tunes at 2011's Bamboozle festival in East Rutherford, New Jersey, to pay homage to one of their biggest influences. "Our fans have definitely grown with and over the years I've been really surprised with some of the bands who have come up to me and told me they love Hot Water Music," Black says. "Some of these kids are literally ten years younger than us and they're still discovering the band; it seems like everyone has a different favorite era or album from the group."Even if Hot Water Music can't perform full-time these days due to the members' other musical obligations, which have included Rebelo's duties in Against Me!, Wollard's output with the Ship Thieves and Ragan's work organizing and performing on the Revival Tour, once they get onstage together that same energy and dynamism that has defined the band's live shows for almost two decades is immediately evident. "I feel like this is a new stage for the band because it's operating in a much different way," Black explains. "There's a lot less on the line and that makes it the whole process more relaxed as opposed to us feeling pressure to sell a certain amount of records or become the hot new band," he summarizes. "We're all really happy to have the opportunity to still be doing this and we can't wait to share our new music with all of the fans who have stuck with us through the years."

Armed and dangerous ain't too many can bang with us. Straight up weed, No angel dust. Label us notorious thug-ass niggas that love to bust. It's strange to us, y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin' up in restaurants with mandolins and violins. We just sittin' here tryin' to win, try not to sin, high off weed and lots of gin. So much smoke, need oxygen, steadily countin' them Benjamins. Nigga, you'd should, too, if you knew what this game would do to you. Been in this shit since ninety-two.

these two kids and their crazy music... they love that rock n roll noise. Alison also plays in a band called The Dirty Legs and Davey is in a band called toomanytiltlpadillas. sometimes we are a quiet moody bluesy folky acoustic band and other times we drink whisky with jaegerbacks, amp on ten, and chase skinheads out of skinhead bars. depending on the mood and the events of the day, everyone is either a target or a close, personal friend. we tell time by our bar tab.

<description>
The origins of IN-SANE go back to the year 1997 in Gornja Radgona, Slovenia, where a bunch of kids who were into punk rock formed a band. The early years of IN-SANE featured some lineup changes, but they eventually formed a steady lineup - Dario (guitar, vocal), Mateja (bass, vocal) and Shaggie (drums). Soon they started to follow their own path, creating their own approach to punk rock, which got labeled as heart-core. In 2005, after a few demo recordings, IN-SANE self-released an excellent debut entitled "Keeping Ourselves Close To Our Hearts", which made it possible for them to play many shows all around Europe. Not missing the chance, in the last 5 years IN-SANE have relentlessly toured Europe, broadening their fan base. They finally made it to a point where the need for the next step was necessary, and then Mr. Moonlee came along! Charmed by their dedication and enthusiasm, he offered cooperation which led to âTrust These Hands Are Worthless." The album âTrust These Hands Are Worthless" was recorded by IN-SANE in their own DIY Life Trip Studio, while mixing and mastering were done with the help of Aco Razbornik in Studio Tivoli. The record is a result of cooperation between various European independent record labels: Moonlee Records (Slovenia), Fond Of Life Records (Germany), No Reason Records (Italy), Shield Recordings (Holland) and Bad Mood Records (Switzerland). This way, IN-SANE and their new album will be presented to potential listeners in the most efficient way all around Europe, giving them a good chance for a bright future. On their new record, IN-SANE remained loyal to their own formula of energetic punk rock, enriched with plenty of hardcore/emo/rock elements and rhythmical twists that give their music special dynamics and charm. The mix of catchy melodies, sharp guitars, thundering bass, fast raging rhythms and breakdowns, along with dual screaming and singing vocals doesn't leave any room for indifference. On the contrary, it will grab you, suck you in and make you ask for more. IN-SANE take the best features from bands like Against Me, Hot Water Music and Propagandhi and combine them into a new and catchy whole. IN-SANE represent all that punk rock should be about energy, dedication, passion and, of course, D.I.Y. ethics. Listen to their new album "Trust These Hands Are Worthless"; let yourself go, raise your fist and sing along!

<description>
Gloucester,Massachusetts can be a tough town. Born and raised in this small port town north of Boston, Jeff Rowe cut his teeth on punk rock. He and his band mates in the now defunct BoxingWater often sang about the frustrations and angst that comes along with an attempt to rise above a backdrop that's trying it's hardest to keep you down. And now, with a new clarity that perhaps comes with time and age, Rowe is telling these stories again. Though comparisons and influences are inevitable, Rowe's brand of acoustic folk has a unique freshness. Without sounding contrived Rowe manages this familiar medium with a natural ease which, as it should be, allows his songs to be the center of our attention. Rowe's songs, though at times extremely personal, have a universality that allows the listener to not only glimpse Rowe's perspective but also urge a sort of self reflection on our part as well. There is no songwriter elitism here, just an honest attempt at showing that music can not only help, but perhaps heal. Frailty, anger, hope, all of which are conditions we all deal with are brought to the forefront in Rowe's music and they are dealt with an insight I believe we can all benefit from. After spending several years in the southern heat of Richmond, Virginia bettering his craft, Rowe returned to Massachusetts and released his first acoustic music as one half of Tomorrow The Gallows, a duo consisting of Rowe and longtime friend Bertram Holdredge. Now, out on his own, Rowe has accumulated a catalog of literally hundreds of songs, a portion of which will be recorded back in Richmond, VA and released as his first proper solo effort. The road awaits. More songs will be written, for Rowe hasn't spent the better part of his life writing and recording music for labels or deadlines or some silly form of status, but because he has too, just as surely as we all have to breathe. J.S. Cochran

Speaking from experience, that's all that Joey Briggs is doing with his latest solo effort. After spending a decade on the road with his band The Briggs, Joey has made it abundantly clear he has a lot to say about his life as a nomad, musician, husband and father. With clever storytelling, he guides us through his "maritime influenced" rants and tales of touring, politics and the music industry that speak directly from the deepest part of his heart and soul.

Hailing from that big cold thing lurking above New York state, Junior Battles play music for lovers. Pimple-faced, awkward lovers who don't understand why everyone they know isn't as enamored of "No Pocky for Kitty" or "Through Being Cool" as they are, and never will. They have an EP on Black Pint, a 7" on Square Up, a split with O Pioneers!!! on Kiss of Death, and a full-length on Paper + Plastick. They also have a 1989 Chevrolet Gladiator camper van with track lighting and a 6" TV, and think you should come hang out.

<description>
Ã¢â¬ÅAnybody who says punk is dead has obviously never heard this band.Ã¢â¬Â Since the fall of 2005 Landmines have been making records and touring the U.S. and Europe, proudly paying homage to those salad days of punk and hardcore that deeply influenced them. They have built their reputation on the merits of their live show, recordings, considerable touring, and legendary partying. Humble and hardworking these guys have achieved more than they could have imagined and their success is a direct result of the honest relationships they have formed with labels, engineers, promoters, bands, and of course friends and fans. The songwriting is thoughtful and mature yet it swells with an intense, sometimes violent youthful energy that is at the core of the music. The sound is fast, heavy, melodic and moody, peppered with tasteful hooks and it isÃ¢â¬Â¦ loud. The vocals have an aggressive approach while still carrying a tune and the lyrics are socially relevant and personally revealing, a lament for lost friends and old traditions, a celebration of redemption and endless possibility or a scathing commentary on the absurdities of modern life. At home and away Landmines have shared the attention of show goers with the likes of Smoke or Fire, American Steel, Bouncing Souls, Rise Against, Ann Beretta, Tim Barry, Chris Wollard, Seaweed, Small Brown Bike, Bad Religion, NOFX, Gaslight Anthem, Off With Their Heads and Less Than Jake, as well as veterans MDC, Citizen Fish, Oi Polloi and Zounds. With the limited release of their demo CD Ã¢â¬ÅDEMONstrationÃ¢â¬Â on local Richmond, VA label Pop Faction Records in 2006, Landmines gained the attention of Vinnie Fiorello the founder of new music/art label Paper + Plastick. Their debut self-titled full length is the first release for the label. Recorded by Brian McTernan at his Salad Days studio in Baltimore (Hot Water Music, Texas is the Reason, Bane, Strike Anywhere, The Loved Ones) and released in July of 2008 this record would see multiple pressings in both Europe and the U.S. The follow up EP Ã¢â¬ÅHell is what you make itÃ¢â¬Â recorded and mixed by Matt Allison at Atlas studios in Chicago (Alkaline Trio, Smoke or Fire, Lawrence Arms and Rise Against) featuring Michael McDermott of the Bouncing Souls on drums was released in September of 2009 digitally on Paper + Plastick and on Gunner Records as a bonus to the full length overseas. Following these 2 releases the band would go on to sign up for a brief stint of Warped Tour as well as successfully touring the U.K. and mainland Europe as a headlining act twice in one year finding a warm welcome from their friends across the pond. The new full length, Ã¢â¬ÅCommerce and MarxÃ¢â¬Â was recorded by the band themselves at Sound of Music studios, Richmond, VA (Avail, Gwar, Strike Anywhere, Lamb of God) and mixed by Stephen Egerton of the Descendents. With the record slated for release in summer of 2011 on Paper + Plastick and TBA on Gunner Records the band is anxious to share the album with new and old fans alike and hit the road in support of it. By the way, these guys tailgate their own shows so donÃ¢â¬â¢t hesitate to bring a cooler of beer, a folding chair and something to throw on the grillÃ¢â¬Â¦all are welcome.

<description>
The six fun-loving fellas in Larry and His Flask are already legends for their live show. In three years of constant touring -- from street corners and punk clubs to an opening slots for Streetlight Manifesto and the Warped Tour -- the Oregon-based band has spread its raucous thrashgrass message far and wide, leaving a legion of slack-jawed fans in their wake. Only problem: Those fans wanted to take home recorded music, and the Flask had very little to offer. Enter "All That We Know," (June 21, Silver Sprocket Bicycle Club) a long-awaited, 14-track collection of string-band party jams that feature what everyone loves about the Flask: furious picking, heartfelt harmonies, buckets of sweaty punk-rock attitude and epic beards. And lest you think the band lacks nuance, check out "Slow It Down," a gorgeous acoustic lament that proves they're capable of much more than just unleashing utter chaos on stage. In fact, they're a finely tuned bunch of musicians who just happen to incite pure joy whenever and wherever they play. "All That We Know" finally captures Larry and His Flask's lightning in a bottle.

<description>
After years of touring the US and Europe with multiple musical projects like We Versus the Shark, Bit Brigade, Pegasuses-XL, and âPowers, Luke Fields found himself old and tired. Then his wrists stopped working correctly. Between frequent panic attacks over the fact that his entire life appeared to be crumbling before him, he explored untapped areas of interest that might provide him with enough courage to not move back in with his parents and work at a gas station until he died. He tried stand-up comedy and found he liked it pretty okay. When his wrists got better and he stopped whimpering all the time, he found that although he was happy to return to music... he might have gotten addicted to stand-up in the process. Luke has performed with a couple shit-hot comedians like Doug Stanhope, Kyle Kinane, Dan St. Germain, Dan Telfer, and Tig Notaro. Luke makes his home in Athens, GA where you can find him at his desk bothering more well-known comedians on Facebook. He still plays in bands and runs a monthly comedy showcase titled âHACKSâ at the Caledonia Lounge. You can find him there and numerous other places, talking about himself way too much.

<description>
Forming in late 2010 LUTHER bring back memories of a simpler and more organic time in rock music. While making no attempts to hide their punk rock roots LUTHER replace the overt aggression flooding the current world of punk with passion and a sincere sense of urgency. Living in South Philadelphia, LUTHER's exposure to the city's diverse music scene creates a varied sound that results in a refreshing mixture of indie, punk rock, post-hardcore and pop. LUTHER's brand of songwriting comes with a natural nervousness that is layered with harmonies and an abstract approach to lyrics, all on top of a driving and unified rhythm section. Coming out swinging, LUTHER have played over 40 shows, an east coast tour, and recorded a 12 inch record with producer Jeff Zeigler (Kurt Vile, The War on Drugs) within a few months.

<description>
Magrudergrind was formed in 2002. The District of Columbia-based band dropped their self-released first record as delinquent teenagers and have since put forth countless splits in addition to two full lengths. Owing much to the close-knit global DIY punk community, since its inception the band has toured Europe and North America multiple times, Puerto Rico, Japan, and South East Asia with the likes of Misery Index, Unholy Grave, Phobia, and Rotten Sound. In 2007, Magrudergrind released their first full length, Rehashed, on Six Weeks Records. 2009 saw Magrudergrind's sophomore full-length, self-titled record on Willowtip Records, engineered by Kurt Ballou (Converge, Misery Index, Torche) and mastered by Scott Hull (Pig Destroyer, Phobia). A sonic escalation of the band's previous amalgam of grindcore and DIY punk, Magrudergrind's acclaimed self-titled release sent them into 2010 with notable appearances at the Scion Rock Festival in Ohio on March 13, the Maryland Deathfest, Memorial Day weekend and Hellfest in Clisson, France in June. In 2011, Magrudergrind will release the "Crusher" EP on Bones Brigade Records and RSR in Europe. Two-thousand-and-eleven sees Magrudergrind appearances at the eclectic SXSW Music Conference in Austin, TX and premier European metal festivals in Holland, Portugal and Czech- Neurotic Death Festival, SWR Festival and Obscene Extreme Festival in Czech

<description>
Sometime at the turn of the century a small gang of boys living in and around Washington D.C. grouped together in the noble pursuit of transcending suburban boredom through the traditional performance of punk rock songs. 3 of these young products of white America never moved on from this adolescent rebellion phase, and 10 years later The Max Levine Ensemble continues to rock basements, bombed out buildings and other holes in the fabric of the status quo, with lofty aspirations of creating moments of pop catharsis for angsty teenagers and maybe shaking punk rock from the mediocrity of its ritualistic lulls. Which is to say, here's another punk rock band. You've definitely seen this before. "Ten years is an impressive milestone for any band, but it is an even more remarkable achievement in D.C., where the tendency is to implode before playing a record release show. With its history of serious-minded harDCore, the District can be a tough town for pop-punk. But a quick skim of David âSpoonboyâ Combsâ lyricsâparticularly on the excellent Them Steadily Depressing, Low Down Mind Messing, Post Modern Recession Blues EPâreveals an astute political consciousness that owes more to Dischordâs heyday than anything from the Lookout! Records catalog." - Washington City Paper

Ryan, Mark, Kaz, and Scotty are a punk band. They play songs about drinking too much, working shitty jobs, attempting to recapture their lost youths, staying up all night and sleeping all day. Ryan cut his teeth playing with Florida heroes Discount for a long time. Heâs old now. He eventually decided to return to his former ethic, starting Monikers after years (and one terrible electronic record) ...living abroad in Scotland. Mark and Kaz have been around the gloryhole of the punk scene over the last decade, so they have lots of funny stories. Scotty (aka Scotty College) is probably the most famous punk in the whole of Florida. He can drink a whole lot and can yell âSkinhead!â loud as hell. They are big fans of hanging out and proud purveyors of Natural Ice. Somehow, Monikers managed to get the songs down, book tours, and even answer their emails (sometimes). Through minimal effort of their own, they have become a real band (they even own a van now), ready to bring their brand of gruff pop-punk to the masses. With the air of Florida media powerhouse Kiss of Death Records.

Mose Giganticus is a four-piece, progressive heavy metal band from Philadelphia, PA. Incubated in the "Do-It-Yourself" music scene of West Philadelphia, Mose Giganticus has evolved to blend the ominous, lumbering weight of sludge and stoner metal with the bombastic pomp and technological expertise of progressive metal, creating a wall of sound that is dark, heavy, and baroque. As front-man and creative force behind Mose Giganticus, Matt Garfield maintains the art of the "well crafted hook" by infusing winding guitar riffs with his signature use of synthesizers and vocoders, producing songs that are as memorable as they are crushing. In July 2010, Mose Giganticus released their Relapse Records debut LP, "Gift Horse," which went on to garner international critical acclaim, including multiple "Best of 2010" listings worldwide (Sonic Abuse London, Metal Injection US, BangBang Canada). Currently, Mose Giganticus continues to tour year-round, painstakingly forging their position on the national touring circuit. To date, Mose Giganticus has performed at over 400 shows and festivals (including The Fest 7, 8, and 9 in Gainesville, FL and upcoming dates at SXSW 2011) across the continental United States, western Canada, the Yukon Territory, and Alaska in their Waste-Vegetable-Oil fueled bus. For fans of: Mastodon, Baroness, The Melvins, Zombi, and Cynic

Hailing from North West Indiana NATIVE is made up of four friends who came together after realizing they were each the most serious about music in each of their former high school bands. The guys each decided to retire their childhood groups and instead come together to form Native in the Summer of 2007. The line up consists of Ed O'Neil /Guitar, Bobby Markos /Vocals and Bass, Dan Evans /Guitar and Nick Glassen on Drums. Since Native's inception they have self released the critically touted EP We, Delete Erase with many publications giving the disc accolades. CMJ remarked, "The brand-new four piece, Native, is making noise even before their first full-length. Their self-released debut EP, We Delete; Erase, their fresh, confident sound is filling their listeners with hope for some great things to come." Also, drawing comparisons to some pretty seminal bands Surfing Magazine described them as "It lands somewhere between a pissed off Minus the Bear and a caged up Botch". Word of mouth about their live shows and their EP caught the attention of US Label and Management company Sargent House who went on to sign the band and who has since re-issued the EP. Native have continued to tour non-stop building quite a following in a short time through their unforgettable live shows and well executed musicianship. A review of their live show in St. Louis from The Riverfront Times stated "There's something about the age-to-talent ratio that makes the post-punk of the barely legal Indiana quartet Native both impressive and genuine. Perhaps it's the group's intelligent guitar work, which recalls the geometric riffs of Jawbox and Faraquet- Or maybe it's the fact that the vocalist's yelps sound more like a pissed Ian MacKaye than a Warped Tour screamo outfit." While Alternative Press' live show assessment was, " For a band just a little more than a year old, Native play with the confidence and prowess of a group of lifers. " The early reviews in for their new full length album Wrestling Moves are no less flattering with Sputnik Music saying "Anyone who has listened to We Delete; Erase will immediately hear the transformation within the band. Native is still Native, but the progression here is a massive one." NATIVE's debut full length Wrestling Moves was released on January 23, 2010 on Sargent House. The album was Produced by Chris Common (These Arms Are Snakes, Pelican) at Red Room Studios in Seattle, WA.

<description>
At last year's Fest, at an afterparty in northwest Gainesville, a drunken Nato Coles was playing the Nigel Tufnel solo classic "Lick My Love Pump" (in D Minor) on an acoustic keytar to a crowd of three passed out Festgoers and a dog that wouldn't stop barking. A fellow staggered up to him and said, "hey, are you Nato from the Modern Machines?" Nato replied "nope, I killed him and ate his brain. Who the hell are you?" The fellow responded, "uhhh... call me Mike... Cranberry. Yeah, that'll do." That night, a bond was forged between Mr. Coles and Mr. Cranberry that would one day result in the birth of the Blue Diamond Band! Today, Kyle Sando on bass and Sam Beer on blazin' lead guitar round out the band. St. Paddy from Dillinger Four once called Nato Coles "the broke man's Greg Cartwright" to his face, then bought a t-shirt, making him slightly less broke. If that means something to you, then don't miss the high energy rock'n'roll sonic sweat pouring from the speakers when Nato and the Blue Diamond Band take the stage at Gainesville Fest IX. The set list is made up of lots of new songs, and some so-called chestnuts from Nato's old bands (Used Kids, Radio Faces, and the Mo-Macs). Nato Coles and the Blue Diamond Band have two new 7" ep's on A.D.D. Records. If you're lucky, they'll sell 'em to ya!

Fans of Dag Nasty, Gorilla Biscuits, Descendents, finger-pointing, stage dives, and breakdowns will soon be freaking the fuck out. Check out their self-titled LP on No Idea and "Traditional Failures" EP on Kiss of Death Records.

<description>
We are three lads (Ben, Chris and Tom) from England playing short and sharp punk rock. We try to play as much as our day-to-day life lets us, skiving of university and work when we can to tour. We've been around Europe, England and a bit of the US, toured with some of our favourite bands and put out a bunch of records on some awesome punk labels. We like having fun, meeting good people, playing to new people and drinking your beer. We'll see you at the front!

<description>
When I hear someone say ânewgrass", I'm usually thinking it's got something to do with a dealer getting a new connection or a dumb thing about resurfacing an outfield, but for the kids in Old Man Markley it's more of a way of life. Wait, what? Nine punks playing together since 2007 with a penchant for old timey porch type shit and red white and blue acoustic guitars? Violins? Girls in the band? A fucking homemade washtub bass??? What is Fat Wreck Chords thinking putting out this 7", entitled For Better, For Worse, due out on October 12th. Have they gone crazy or are these California kids really that good?<br />
 <br />
 Well, part of it may have to do with the fact that the music industry is going out of business, but most of it has to do with the fact that Old Man Markley sounds like what would happen if Mike Ness woke up drunk in a bed with the guys in Old Crow Medicine Show and decided to just make a record rather than do the walk of shame, and let's face it people: that's just awesome, and if you don't think so you truly have no soul. You could wimp out and just say they're the Dropkicks of bluegrass, but that would be reductive and crappy, so let's instead get down to business:<br />
 <br />
 Old Man Markley comes from the San Fernando Valley, just like all your favorite internet downloads. And they've also got nine people in them, just like all your favorite internet downloads. BUT they're also gonna tour with NOFX and Bouncing Souls in early '11 in order to ring in their first full length on Fat Wreck, and none of the girls from Dong Garglers #12 can say that, can they? Of course not.<br />
 <br />
 Listen, these guys and gals played their first show as recently as 2008 but with a pedigree that includes former and current members of Youth Brigade, Angel City Outcasts and Blue Collar Special, you know you're dealing with a pretty wild strain of Bluegrass. Hell, there's a husband/wife team up in here and even a guy who's last name is Balls! So strap on your dicks and/or vaginas and get ready for southern California's bluegrass scene. If they can make people dance on the bar to down home bluegrass music in a Hollywood fantasy world awash in strawberry cocaine and anal bleaching, then they're sure to put a smile on your un-botoxed face. And listen, they're good looking, polite and they'll make your mom say shit like âwho was that nice boy that played the washboard in that one band that sang that song that your dad and I liked about driving long distances with the cops chasing you?" and you'll have to say something like, âYou know what mom, I like Neil Diamond, you like Old Man Markley. Let's call it even and never talk about this again, okay?"

<description>
The first time I heard One Win Choice was back in 2008, when our bands were playing together at Asbury Lanes in New Jersey in front of 25 people, give or take. At first, I sort of dismissed them as another young, punk-tinged hardcore band. I had no idea how long they had been around, but I was actually kind of annoyed at their elation, motivation and the sheer enjoyment they got out of playing in a band, at a venue in front of virtually no one. âThese kids are just too young, too 'stoked' to really get it," I told myself. âIn a couple years the scene, the politics of being in a band and the countless miles spent driving to gigs where no one shows up will eventually wear them down." I couldn't be happier to admit how incredibly wrong I was. On Conveyor, One Win Choice's newest full-length, the boys step up their game, turn their amps to eleven and tap into all the other metaphors that music critics use to describe when a band has written a flat-out amazing record. Channeling ethos and intensity of bands such as Comeback Kid, Strike Anywhere and perhaps little more than a pinch of Refused, and combining melodic punk elements not unlike A Wilhelm Scream or Rise Against, this Philadelphia, P.A. outfit is the bastion of everything punk rock should strive to be. Socially aware without sounding preachy, intense while displaying restraint, the songs that make up Conveyor take you on a journey of five guys who still give a shit about music, the community and the mark they make on both of those entities. Granted, One Win Choice isn't breaking any new ground and they often stick to a mostly perfected formula. What makes these guys and this record stand out is the fire, passion and intensity the burns beneath it all. Nothing seems forced, and tracks like âMovements," âAct Your Age" and âHands Over Hearts" highlight the band's perfect grasp of the phrase "sonic annihilation." Still, these songs weren't created to simply incite kids to sick-mosh or stage-dive. One Win Choice has grown immensely as songwriters and Conveyor is meticulously crafted while exploding with emotion, sincerity and thought-provoking lyrics. My friends in One Win Choice recently toured through Atlanta to play a poorly promoted show at a small art space. Three years later and the members of the band still maintain all of the exhilaration, the drive and joy from playing music together that they had back at that gig at Asbury Lanes. In today's scene, it is incredibly refreshing to find honest people who are conscious of the impact they are leaving on the scene around them. Whenever you get bummed out on the current state of music, put on Conveyor and remind yourself that there is hope out there. This record is a reminder of all the things punk and hardcore should be.

<description>
Dan Yemin may not quite be an "elder statesmen" of punk, but his impact on it throughout the past 15 years certainly approaches Mt. Rushmore status. After establishing a melodic edge to the precedings with Lifetime and Kid Dynamite, Yemin has finally "stepped to the mic" with Paint it Black. Conveying the intensely personal (try a brush with death) as well as the overtly political (war, chemical dependency and "womb envy"), Yemin and company continue to leave room for the threatening urgency of a beautifully writ "fuck you" song. Drawing on traditionally aggro forebears like Minor Threat, musical innovators like Swiz and the cold-stare lyricism of hip hop, Paint it Black is a mixed-bag success story worthy of its pedigree.

Pianos Become the Teeth has a melodic yet uncompromising sound that brings to mind such diverse and influential bands as Thursday, Envy and City of Caterpillar. Brimming with sincerity and brandishing an experimental ambiance, the band is pushing beyond the boundaries of a stale genre. Mixing elements of screamo, hardcore as well as post rock.

To know PJ Bond is to know someone who loves pizza. But, we're talking proper pizza here, not that stuff in the midwest that they cut into squares, despite it being a round shape to start and being a âpie." Once while in Ohio, Bond overheard someone say, âI love the parts on the end where you get a little bit of the crust and a little bit of the middle." You know, out east they figured out how to make every slice like that. Growing up in the shadow of New York City provided Bond with a steady supply of delicious bread and cheese based foods that surely sullied his ability to enjoy lesser level combinations of these heavenly staples. But, travel still he did, both far and wide. In this idiom one might assume âfar" refers to the ânorth/south" travel, as presumably âwide" is âeast/west." But, we digress. Unencumbered by traditional trappings such as home, a backlog of possessions or need to visit a centralized family, Bond took to the road with his '93 Sundance, a guitar, and a desire to meet and sing for as many people as he could. And to try the world's pizza. In an attempt to shake out the dust accumulated from years of working with unfulfilling musical projects, there were a few small jaunts around the US which turned into moves north to Canada and eventually overseas to the UK, mainland Europe and India. One might think after all of these travels there should be some sort of capitulation; well, one would be correct. The goal after a straight 365 days of moving his bones around the globe was for Bond to collect his tales of adventure, woe and excitement and pen a book delightfully titled, âYear of a thousand roommates." A lovely goal, for sure, and a lofty one at that. But being a man unhappy with sitting still, Bond kept touring, kept moving, jotting down as many notes as possible in an attempt to keep the project alive. The two years of near continuous traveling have included two trips to the Fest, and this year will surely prove to be equally as exciting, fun and beer soaked. Throughout these travels Bond continued to write music that speaks to honesty and real life. Ryan Weber of Gainesville's own Spanish Gamble once told Bond, âI love that you're such a scumbag. You don't hide what you're really feeling, and they are things we can all relate to." Songs of late night introspection, uncomfortable exchanges, distaste for the negative aspects in our lives and hope for improvement all flow from Bond in a way that is hard to ignore. Happy and full of sing-a-longs his songs may be not, but honest and open, and worth digging into, they surely are. Eventually the travels will slow, more songs will be written, book drafts will be typed and perhaps at some point, there will be an actual bed for Bond to lay in. Until that time, check out his music, say hello at a show, or just keep an eye peeled for him at Leo's or Big Lou's.

Protagonist, lying hidden behind the plastic aesthetic and the mass of consumers in Boca Raton, Florida, play their own brand of melodic punk anthems. Led by desperate vocals, racing guitars and an unrelenting drum assault, they stick out like a festering sore in a city known more for its riches and beaches than music. Protagonist takes punk rock and plays it at face value. For them it is an outlet to shout, sing and cry-out against everything that is wrong in the world. Before the onslaught of social networking sites that have facilitated the laziest and most undeserving bands to get a tour booked with the click of a mouse, Protagonist were jump-starting their hometown scene with their hardworking DIY ethic. Always active, they released demos and booked and promoted their own shows at VFW halls and skate-parks all over Florida. TheyÃ¢â¬â¢re steadfast attachment to the DIY ethos helped Protagonist build a fan base in Florida and abroad after beginning to actively tour in 2001. All this work would not go unnoticed. Legendary New York Hardcore label Blackout! Records (H20, Kill Your Idols, Sheer Terror) took notice and released the band's first full-length record entitled Ã¢â¬ÅHope and RageÃ¢â¬Â in 2003. Well received by critics, the band toured relentlessly on the album garnering more attention than ever. Protagonists next step would be to write, record and release their next effort the Ã¢â¬ÅReasoning with TimeÃ¢â¬Â EP. The short 5 song record (featuring 3 originals and two covers) is over before you know it, but not before showcasing their growth both musically and lyrically. In 2008 they kept the nonstop touring assault in full-effect, even venturing as far as Japan to showcase their melodic hardcore punk to an extremely receptive Asian audience. In 2008, Protagonist finished their highly anticipated second full-length. Titled, Ã¢â¬ÅThe ChronicleÃ¢â¬Âthey recorded the album in their hometown before sending it to Jamie Woolford (The Stereo, Punchline, The AKAÃ¢â¬â¢s) to mix it at Room Sound. Upon hearing the record Vinnie decided in a heartbeat that he wanted to put it out on Paper + Plastick. In June of 2010, Protagonist went back into the studio to record their newest EP "States" with producer Stephen Egerton (ALL, Descendents) and an handful of touring is in the works to accompany it's April '11 release.

Pure Graft are a tech punk band from the dark, grim North of the UK. What do I mean by that? I mean it's clear while listening to Pure Graft that they love shitty metal. Don't panic though! Pure Graft won't shred your face off, more lightly grate on you like a mild venereal disease. Watching Pure Graft it is clear why they're such a hit in the punx scene and the bear scene. With lead singer Danny (L Dog) Lester's (seen on the cover of Bear Monthly) stage presence more "carry on up the punx" than the hard tech punk front man you would expect. The popularity of Pure Graft is based loosely on their catchy songs about stuff and things, but more down to the unconditional love of the UK's most organised man and Caves drummer Dave Brent! While not prancing around on stage at fest expect to find the lads drinking your booze and chatting to your girlfriend. Especially guitarist and notorious prowler Dave (the sex owl) Hillier. Pure Graft must have done something right last year at fest to be invited back, so why not come watch and figure it out for yourselves? 'cos I'm fucking stumped.

<description>
Acoustic strums, beautiful vocal harmonies, pianos, keyboards, and swelling ambient noise- not the kind of music one might assume would come from a band made up of veteran punk musicians, on a veteran punk record label. This is just the next step in the journey of Northern Virginia's Pygmy Lush, one that has been marked by redefinition and rebirth. The sound of this record is one that's come only with age and experience, after thousands of miles have been logged in cramped touring vans. They're following a path that many punks seem to follow as the years go on; The need for quiet, the need for space, for reflection and introspection, but the same amount of need for honesty, passion and expression. These feelings get put into something tangible in an old farmhouse near a far out Washington D.C. suburb, where Pygmy Lush live, write and practice, tucked away. They've tried to carve out a niche of solace in the middle of endless sameness, a place where they can stand. A lot of the songs are about friendships and connection, unsurprisingly. The things that bind us together through the years, and the things that split us apart. On the title track, vocalist Chris Taylor makes a declaration to his community. I'll make a promise to all my friends/I'll never leave this world without you...the end isn't distance/it's just a place to stay. What is life when you've found your world, your purpose for it all? What is left? Anyone with two eyes and a brain might love reading through the lyric sheet for Taylor's humorous and heartbreaking honesty. "Chewing on trash, fluorescent blues/Don't eat the food/Don't even move." A couple of new members help to seal the deal on Old Friends. Aimee Argote of Des Ark; friend, tourmate, labelmate, and now honorary member, contributes vocals to over half the tracks, and some piano as well. You might have seen new drummer Eric Kane over the years, serving up a fast paced soundtrack to stagediving and high fiving for Richmond punk act Strike Anywhere. All these elements combine to make a somber and introspective piece of music that defies any genre labels. Pygmy Lush are the kind of band that bring people together, leaving any room unspeakably silent after they play. Keep this one around for being inside, when it eventually starts getting chilly again, or even when the unbearable heat of summer sends you seeking refuge indoors. You're gonna need it. Old Friends was recorded and mixed in just 4 days by Kurt Ballou in Salem, MA. The band will be touring most of 2011 in support of the record.

Red Collar plays rock and roll. Of course that can mean a lot of things but at its core that's what Red Collar's music is, period. It's the effrontery of early 90's Dischord bands. It's straightforward, working- class lyrics with the earnest delivery of Springsteen. It's the shout-along choruses of The Replacements and the buoyant, danceable rhythms of The Clash. Taken together, it's a bold, energetic wall of sound that dares the audience to come a little closer and join in the fun.

<description>
Regents, whose members hail from a 200 mile stretch of i95, are veterans of some of the most influential hardcore bands of the 90's including Maximillian Colby, Sleepytime Trio, Frodus, The Exploder, Men's Recovery Project, Battery, and Combat Wounded Veteran. Band mates David NeSmith, Drew Ringo, Dan Evans and Jason Hamacher have come together to form a brutal and heavily charged punk band.<br />
 <br />
 Regents formed in the summer of 2007 when NeSmith and Hamacher were playing as a keytar and drum duo called Regions. The following year Ringo and Evans moved back to the east coast and both separately approached David about playing music. NeSmith called a meeting and the three quickly realized their mutual goals. A call to Hamacher turned Regions from a duo into a quartet. A misunderstanding on RingoÃ¢â¬â¢s part changed the band name from Regions to Regents and the rest is history. <br />
 <br />
 Drawing inspiration from years playing in basements, squats, and living rooms Regents crafted four songs of pure ferocity laden with heavy hitting drums, distorted ringing guitars and blood curdling screams. Recorded by Joseph Mitra at Wired Wrists, the four songs will be released as a 7 inch record from Lovitt Records. Presented here are the forces of Frodus, Sleepytime Trio, andThe Exploder, combined and shaken, delivering a faster, more direct, and purer sonic cocktail that than any of their previous offerings.

<description>
There seems to be a common theme developing within recent reviews for Restorations' Strange Behavior - the terrific four-song EP released last year by Paper + Plastick, which is that this Philly outfit plays music for "grown-up punks." I'm not sure if that's necessarily true as the band's background, touring history and all-around response to its relatively short discography collectively point to the fact that its appeal spans generations of music fans. From hardcore, post-punk, shoegaze, americana, roots rock and even stoner metal, the overwhelming consensus that Restorations' singular sound is difficult to pin down (though it's fun to try) and originates from an undeniably earnest place - something that is universally easy to get on board with. So from what I can tell, "grown-up punks" is merely a term used to describe what the band is not. It's not music made solely for adults; on the other hand, you're not going to find much in the way of buzz-saw riffs, throat-shredding screams or breakneck drumming. And if you're searching for a record where playing loud and fast trumps playing well, I'd go elsewhere. Of course, that doesn't mean that Restorations' brilliant Self-Titled debut full-length isn't exploding with passion and electricity (it is) and we're certainly not inferring that these eight amazing songs won't rip through your skull before knocking the wind out of you with repeated sonic gut punches (they do). What we are emphatically stating is that if you've been searching for a thoughtful, nuanced take on punk and indie rock, and all the sub-genres they entail, Restorations might just be your new favorite band. Need proof? Listen no further than the stunning opener "Nonlocality," with its atmospheric, spine-tingling intro, gorgeous harmonies and crushing wall of sound which closes out a track that feels nothing short of epic. For the album's 33 + minute duration, Restorations follows a similar trajectory, creating songs that are intricately layered, tension-building monsters which lean heavily on a rhythm section that could probably knock a hole in the side of a Sherman tank. Still, that never takes away from the band's ability to craft warm, stirring melodies, enduring hooks and dense, dynamic song structures. Cascading guitars, pulsing waves of reverb and spacey flourishes are held together by Jon Loudon's raspy-yet-tuneful growl. His delivery is one that transmits confidence, wisdom and a bit of wear and tear, perhaps from years fronting post-hardcore heroes Jena Berlin, but he also sings with a soulful, youthful exuberance that feels like he genuinely loves the process of creating music. Perhaps that is Restorations' strength as a cohesive unit, that even though this Self-Titled record is a serious work of art with many subtle complexities, achingly intense moments of restraint and driving need to find a unique voice, it also resonates as if it were an absolute joy to write and perform. Even the pristine recording and production from Algernon Cadwallader's Joe Reinhart allows the band to maintain a raw, loose aesthetic and foundation-shaking low end that owes a much to the members' punk and hardcore roots. If we were to speak in metaphors, Restorations is like a menacing storm on the horizon, steadily rumbling across dusty plains and jagged mountains and enveloping everything in its path. Its impending arrival is a nail-biting experience and the anticipation is nearly as dramatic as the actual event, which in itself is a moving, white-knuckled affair. Pouring down dense sheets of cathartic sound, Restorations washes away the throngs of stale, unimaginative bands that pollute the once-inspired reservoirs of independent music and breathes new air into tired lungs. Perhaps that's why this Self-Titled effort speaks so loudly to us "over-the-hill" punk rockers. It's not that Restorations is a band comprised of jaded old punks; it's that some of us have been around long enough to hear (what feels like) everything music has to offer. Every once in a while we need a group to cleanse our palates and get us stoked on the scene again. For these ears, and I'm sure many of yours, Restorations is that band, and the term "grown-up punk" is not about leaving behind the fire of our youth but rather the exciting possibilities and new frontiers that years of experience can underline.

These days, it's all too easy for young bands to fall through the cracks and fail to muster any sort of staying power. Each genre is becoming more and more oversaturated and we can all agree that "whiskey soaked" and "gravely" vocals aren't anything new. However, every now and then a band is able to come out of the woodwork and put a fresh perspective on post-hardcore music -- never focusing on an image or a certain bandwagon. Such is the case for Reverse The Curse. RTC hail from the small town of Hiram, OH, where the three first started playing in sixth grade. Still practicing in the same basement they formed in, Ed Starcher (vocals, guitar), Connor Johnson (bass, vocals), and Joey Regets (drums) have created their most cohesive, powerful, and meaningful material to date with their upcoming full-length debut. "Hither and Yon" is slated for a June 2011 release. Recorded in the fall of 2010 with Eric Cronstein in Columbus, OH, this full length follows their 2009 "Paths" EP (recorded in 2008, a week after they graduated from high school, released by Lock and Key Collective). Whereas many bands call it quits after graduating, Reverse The Curse held together, toured incessantly, and unashamedly created honest and driven music that's as powerful as it is fresh. Haunting and infectious, slow churning yet commanding swells intertwine with ghostly tones to deliver an immeasurably memorable record. Don't let their age fool you. Reverse The Curse are here to stay.

Run Forever is a three piece punk band rooted in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This band is our tiny voice among the many artists, teachers, poets, musicians and activists that share the same passion for creating, expressing and sharing as we do. We spend as much time as we can on the road and hope that we are able to be a positive and radiant hearted presence in the DIY music scene. We're extremely grateful for all of the incredible people we've met along the way whom without we would not be able to continue traveling, sharing our music, and doing what we love.

Forever and always pushing forward into the unknown, (the) Saint Alvia (cartel) are back exploring musical boundaries with their new album "The Static" ( March 2012). Maintaining the spirit of bands like The Clash and The Band, with influences ranging from 20's era blues to modern lo-fi these 2 time Juno nominees have been lying low perfecting a personal sound and formula. Alvia's dirty, hook ladened sound successfully draws on classic blues mixed with a DC post punk vibe while invoking a mod flare and rhythm that is unmistakably new and fresh. Three years have passed since Saint Alvia have released a full length studio album and early reports say it's hands down their best work to date. It is safe to say, no bands out there sound like (the) Saint Alvia (cartel).

Throughout the 90s, this band did a shit load of tours and albums. In 2000, they released their 6th full-length album, 'Astray', and did several tours of North America before unceremoniously calling it quits. Not taking astrangement too seriously, they managed to tour Europe and South America half a dozen times in the years to come. So much for being 'broken up'. The band, uh, 'regrouped' in 2006 and released a 7th album, 'whatever's got you down' followed by several tours of europe, australia and south america as well as scattered us dates, notably 2009's fest 8. In 2010, no idea released a compilation of outtakes and live recordings from the band major label years (1994-1997) with the hopes of following up with rereleases of 'Clumsy' and 'You Are Freaking Me Out' (the 2 major label releases). Unfortunately, red tape and bureacracy stalled those plans. The band sets out to record their 8th studio album in april/may 2011 in SF/Brooklyn with Alex Newport...with any luck a 9th might follow somewhere around 2016?!?!? please keep an eye out for tour dates, because they turn up in the darnest of places.

<description>
The roots of Michigan's SHORES tap the wellspring of RED HOUSE PAINTERS, BEDHEAD, THE NEW YEAR, CODEINE, LOW, SPAIN, SEAM, and SLOWDIVE. The first haunting note of "Coup de Grace" rings out, clear and clean, followed in time by another drenched in natural reverb, the living sound of a dark, wooden room. Not a cathedral, not a church, but a place of warmth and comfort nonetheless. The patient crescendo builds, the percussion kicks in, rocketing the dynamics into full play. Clean guitars, loud drums, clear vocals. Purposeful over casual, downbeat yet forward moving. Dark, not depressing. A rainy day, a late night adventure. -Var.

Four Beethovens hatched from raptor eggs and were fed a heavy diet of Long Island punk and hardcore. The result is Sister Kisser, a couple of zany brains making music from the heart. Though familiar in nature, Sister Kisser have crafted their own brand of melodic, DIY punk rock.

<description>
In 2008, after the releases of Above The City and This Sinking Ship, both on Fat Wreck Chords, Smoke Or Fire found themselves at a bit of a crossroads. A follow-up to the aforementioned Ship was due to be written and recorded and tours of Japan, Australia, New Zealand, as well as five weeks in Europe, were booked. At the time however, none of the four members lived in the same city. In fact, the band had become bi-coastal, with two members living on the West coast and two on the East. Coordinating time to write together, practice, and tour was becoming increasingly difficult. Balancing jobs and busy home lives with the desire to be a full-time band was proving harder than it had ever been before. But being a band that believed in themselves and the rewards that come from hard work they pushed onward. Writing and demoing of new material was produced and a decision was made to record the new album after the tours of Asia, Australia, and Europe were complete. The next several months the band spent traveling the world gave them some of the most rewarding experiences of their lives. Seeing so many enthusiastic faces so far from home was proof positive that their music had reached far beyond the borders of the U.S. Upon returning to the States the band decided to give themselves a well-deserved break and allow themselves time to digest and reflect upon all the amazing things they had felt and seen in such a small amount of time. But after some time had passed, and perspective gained, singer/guitarist Joe McMahon and guitarist Jeremy Cochran decided it was time to get back at it. After all, there was a whole new batch of songs to be recorded and sung and so many new people to try to reach. Spurred on by a desire to return the stage and to the road, in particular the rapidly approaching SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas, Smoke Or Fire recorded and released the Prehistoric Knife Fight 7" in March of 2010, also on Fat Wreck. In the summer of 2010 The Speakeasy, the long due follow up to This Sinking Ship, was recorded in Chicago by Matt Allison, the same man behind the boards for Ship. âWe wanted to make the best sounding record we could and still retain some of the grit from our older recordings and our live show. And I think we accomplished that. We feel extremely comfortable and focused in Chicago with Matt and I think the relationship we have with him and that city makes us fell that, no matter what, weâll be leaving with something we know we worked really hard on and that we can be proud of.â says Cochran. The Speakeasy boasts the bands strongest and most collective songs to date with the albums first two tracks âIntegrityâ and âMonsters Among Usâ leading the way. With Justin âGwomperâ Burdick (bass, AVAIL) and Ryan Parrish (drums, Darkest Hour) filling out the line up on The Speakeasy, Smoke Or Fire has returned with a new sense of confidence, urgency, and direction. Though itâs been a while since weâve heard new music from Smoke Or Fire, itâs been worth the wait. The Speakeasy shows us that in the life of a band the journey can be just as important as the destination.

Cross contra cripple crescent, SC lives demands the present. The boys secede again: throughout, above, and beyond it all. The thunder may be, simply, rock and roll, punk, thrash, drone, distortion. Le ss a cosmos, more a fist fight, the record battles with sense and judgment, other times without. Anthems with rigidity and a force towards resolution: music to bang your head to. Songs with low end and an encompassing trance: it's not how you drive, it's how you arrive. A 5 song EP announcing the present, cross contra cripple crescent!

We've all been at the end of our rope's before, that precarious tipping point where you're not sure whether everything's going to work itself out, or whether you're going to end up as a deranged 30-something basement screamer chewing on the business-end of a broken bottle. "It's All Coming Down" zeroes in on these feelings, a Richter-scale reading on imminent mental collapse. As Spanish Gamble have waged their own wars across the underground over the past few years, they've clawed their way up the totem pole from the position of determined underdog to scrappy welterweights. They've built a healthy reputation for riling house shows into reckless abandon and will surely be wide-awake, blacked-out, and giving any willing soul a homemade tattoo in your living room long after you've passed out. In turn, the music speaks for itself - driving and melodic, rife with compelling leads and behemoth choruses. Each song stands as an anthem unto itself, whether defiant or rallying, hopeful or hopeless.

What can be said about SSSSNAKES that hasn't already been said by this photo. Amazing. SSSSNAKES live show is most commonly described as being the musical equivalent to Carrot Top's stand up comedy. Take that however you'd like. If SSSSNAKES was an animal it would be a naked mole rat, with a boner. Richard Simmons has been quoted as saying "This band sucks" about them. The last time this band had a good review, so did Right Said Fred. When SSSSNAKES aren't writing 3-chord abortions, you can often find them cramming alka-seltzer into each other's asses or talking about Mothman's taupe dick. Perhaps the most identifying quality of the band is not their music, but the fact that they are the founders of the Andrew Cream Fan Club, as well as the Andrew Cream Street Team and the Andrew Cream Center for Andrew Cream. The band is comprised of one Half Man Half Cat on drums, the Old Bean on guitar, a Lush on bass, and Old Cloud Knees on vox. When you see them at their fest debut, buy them a nice strong SOP and you might have a chance at seeing their british uncut dongs come out!

<description>
Static Radio are a tropical world music band from the Garden State. While not on tour spreading the word of love, SR can be found running a small community farm to help disadvantaged children.<br />
 <br />
 Static have had a tough year having to change their name from Static X for legal reasons and undergoing a bit of a line up change. It is yet to be seen if these change are for the better! Joining the band for fest on second guitar is sick of it all super fan Charles. Not only does Charles play the songs moderately well but he also bring a much needed bit of hard core creed to the band with his 90's era jumps.<br />
 <br />
 The newest addition to the band is Tampa, Florida's Chris Krause (Arm the Poor, Devout, Bible Dinosaurs). Chris is known for his fond love of bird watching and baking skills. He is also an avid collector of British royal family memorabilia!<br />
 <br />
 Static Radio are returning to Fest for the SIXTH and most interesting time. Having just recorded their new album "Horse Cocks and Punx Jumps" which they describe them self as it having a "out there sound." We are all surely in for a treat

Chris Clavin said some really sweet things about us for our profile on the Plan-It X website and so we're just gonna quote him here in lieu of our full biography; I'm sure you can find that elsewhere: "On various, lucky occasions in my touring life I've bumped into John and Megan. Every time has been a pleasure and I'm glad to know them. When they teamed up to form Street Eaters, I knew it would be great. I think the first time I saw them live was the after-fest-party/show that I booked one year at wayward council, in Gainesville, Fl. They were really great. Instantly I was reminded of so many bands I like but also felt like I was hearing something totally unique and original. They are a two piece that sounds like a four piece... They are a little spooky, they are a little riot grrrl, they are a little heavy, they are a little poppy and very clever. I love what they do. But, more importantly they are great people that make the most sincere attempts to connect with other humans that I've ever felt. They're sweet, smart and charming and do cool things in their "real" life. Also, they built a totally soundproof practice room in their Berkeley basement. The room doesn't even touch the floor. They can practice at any hour. It's like a secret lab where they mix up top secret songs. In short, check them out. You haven't heard anything exactly like what they do and if you ever get the chance, see them live and say hello to them. You won't be disappointed by the music or the people." --Chris Clavin, Plan-It X Records

<description>
Such Gold has had several incarnations over the years, but in January 2009 the Rochester, New York natives officially solidified their lineup. Ben Kotin (vocals), Nate Derby (guitar), Tim Heald (guitar), Devon Hubbard (bass) and Devan Bentley (drums) had finally found solid ground. Later that year, the band reaped the rewards of their tireless efforts by releasing their much-acclaimed debut EP, Stand Tall. Now, the New York five-piece is ready to showcase just how far they've come with their brand-new EP on 6131 Records, Pedestals. Fans of Such Gold may have been attracted to the band's pop-punk stylings on Stand Tall, but Derby says that the group has undergone somewhat of a transformation in one year's time. "We're completely different people than we were last year," he says. "A lot has happened to us since we released Stand Tall, and we've really grown as musicians. I think the record really shows that. Pedestals is much more mature - I think we've finally found our sound." Citing influences such as Saves the Day, Hot Water Music, Boys Night Out, The Progress, At the Drive-In and Propagandhi, Pedestals marries the group's love for old school pop-punk, hardcore and indie rock, without alienating the fans that have latched onto the palatable sound on their first EP. "We all listen to hardcore," Derby says. "And even though we don't really play traditional hardcore, we play at the same tempo as most of the bands in that genre and we identify with the music and most of its ideals. We are definitely a hardcore band at heart." Produced by Greg Altman (Four Year Strong, A Loss For Words) and engineered by Nik Tyler and Josh Unruh, Such Gold holed up in a lavish Baltimore mansion to record Pedestals. Tyler and Unruh were in-between full-time work and offered up their new work-in-progress studio to the band. The band all agrees that "it felt like we were a million-dollar band." According to the earnest guitarist, the title track from Pedestals is the heaviest song the band has written to date. "It's probably the fastest song we've done, as well." Derby says. Strongly influenced by the band's hardcore roots, 'Pedestals' also features guest vocals from fellow Upstate New York native and Earth Crisis singer Karl Buechner. The road for Such Gold has been and will continue to be a long one, but for the band, whose members are all in their early twenties, it's the only course they want to pursue right now. "For some reason it just made sense that this is what we're supposed to do," Derby explains. "We've all been in and out of bands since we were freshmen in high school, and I think we've finally reached the point where we can be successful in playing music. We're putting everything into this." Such Gold will be touring the world in the upcoming year in support of Pedestals. The band plans to release a full-length album in 2011, but until then, the guys are happy with carving out a space for themselves and the music they create. "I know in my heart that we're different than a lot of other bands," Derby says. "I know we're doing something right."

<mp3/>
<description>
Anyone who was lucky enough to see Ted Leo and the Pharmacists live over the last year or so got an advance preview of some of the songs that make up THE BRUTALIST BRICKS. I was at a more than a few of those shows, and let me just say that as someone who has witnessed some of the most important rock shows in the last twenty-plus years* I could not believe what my eyes were seeing and my ears were hearing.<br />
 <br />
 So many times bands play âthe new stuffâ and itâs time to pull out the old iPhone and check your fantasy basketball stats. But these songs sent a shock of genuine excitement through the crowd, as if the band was cranking out an old favorite like âMe and Miaâ or âWhere Have All the Rude Boys Gone?â. I was even a little suspicious - you know how when you see a band and they play something so good that it just has to be a cover? Thatâs how I felt about hearing âWhere Was My Brain?â and âBottled In Corkâ for the first time. Surely these were not new songs!<br />
 <br />
 But when Ted Leo himself told me post-show that they were among the new stuff, I knew what I had to do. I sat the band down, looked them in the eye and said with songs like that on deck, the new Ted Leo and the Pharmacists record was theirs to lose and they better not mess it up.***<br />
 <br />
 I am happy to say that they most certainly Brought It. From the opening facepunch of âThe Mighty Sparrowâ to the thank-you-goodnight stomp of âLast Daysâ THE BRUTALIST BRICKS is a ripper that distills all that TL/Rx have been working towards over the last decade into thirteen monster tracks.<br />
 <br />
 I know what youâre saying â what makes it so great, loudmouth? Well, jerk, it starts with the songs. While I love all the preceding TL/Rx records like they were related to me, this bakerâs dozen is inarguably the strongest batch that Ted has ever assembled. There are straight up HITS on this thing. From âOne Polaroid A Dayâ to âBottled In Corkâ To âEven Heroes Have To Dieâ and beyond, this album is stuffed with straight-up capital C Classics.<br />
 <br />
 But enough about Ted - how about the Pharmacists? Could they be more in the pocket?**** Chris Wilsonâs drumming has never sounded better. Marty Key holds down the Thud Stick***** it owes him money. And James Canty is Mr. Everything, taking the songs to another level with his whipsmart guitar and keyboardings. Ted is the anchor, but the Pharmacists are the reason the whole thing crushes like it does.<br />
 <br />
 As a fan of Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, THE BRUTALIST BRICKS is everything I hoped they would bring to their Matador debut. Itâs the intersection of songs and performance from a band that embodies the perfect synthesis of head and heart. Music is generally a case of individual taste, but if you donât like this record the only thing I can think is that youâre wrong and kinda stupid and I donât want anything to do with you.******<br />

 *Um, the first night of A.R.M.S Concert at Madison Square Garden, anyone?**<br />
 <br />
 ** What, you donât remember the A.R.M.S. concert?! Clapton? Ron Wood? Jimmy Page doing songs from the DEATH WISH II soundtrack? Doesnât the debut of what would become The Firm mean anything anymore?<br />
 <br />
 *** I have since been told this is not how things âwent downâ.<br />
 <br />
 **** No!<br />
 <br />
 ***** Thatâs right, the Thud Stick. You might know it as a bass guitar.<br />
 <br />
 ****** Unless you have a board tape of the December 9th 1983 A.R.M.S. concert? Anyone?

<description>
It was once opined upon me that in order to create timeless music, one must avoid language and allusions that tie the songs to a specific frame of reference. The DevilÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s advocate within immeditely threw The Arrivals back in their face, and that conversation was over. When I think about why The Arrivals are such a powerful band, my focus centers on the indisputable mastery they hold over the art of songcraft. From they ground up, theyÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢ve simply got it. On the surface, the record kicks off with fistfuls of hooks; each song a fresh round; never a dull moment between. Their musicianship runs deeper though, as the harmonies flow with a novel complexity far beyond their peers. Over strong bones, the meat of this record lies in IsaacÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s musings, which examine and inspire in a sort-of blue collar armchair philosopher manner. Looking out on the world with the mellowed aggression of a Midwestern punk whoÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s known their fair share of a hard dayÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s work, Isaac mulls over social and political issues with a thoughtfulness that we should all aspire to. With the same fire in their eyes that drove The Clash to the height of their pop-culture power, The Arrivals are carving a path through the jungle of contemporary music, clawing their way towards a musical El Dorado where their songs will live on forever.

<description>
Ã¢â¬ÅNAKED RAYGUN was a huge inspiration for me. Along with Fugazi and Leatherface, they helped create the bedrock that defines the Ã¢â¬ÅGainesville soundÃ¢â¬Â. As much as I discredit the root idea that such a sound even exists or is quantifiable to such a finite point, I will at least concede that there are certain key influences for many a young (at heart) local miscreant.<br />
 <br />
 I digress. The fact that twenty-one years after NR played a legion hall in Gainesville, we are putting out a record that not only stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the best NR album, but perhaps surpasses, well, this blows me away. I have a hard time finding words that express how much PezzatiÃ¢â¬â¢s voice shakes me to the core. So IÃ¢â¬â¢ll abandon words entirely and quote the man himself Ã¢â¬ÅWhoa Hey HoÃ¢â¬Â. Yes. This record means that much.<br />
 <br />
 Crafting the music and bringing the workhorse/powerhouse ethic are Jeff Dean, Mike Soucy, and Pete Mittler, who have truly risen to the occasion. They have been in countless Chicago bands, and continue to split their time with several noteworthy, exceptional bands, including The Methadones and Four Star Alarm. Energy. Focus. Intensity.<br />
 <br />
 As if it could get any better, the album was recorded by J. Robbins, who also makes appearances on various songs. He really brought out the best in the band and songs, amplifying and directing, especially in the vocal harmonies and melodies. Pezzati turned in vocals on the last Paint It Black album, and Dan Yemin returns the favor here. Bob Nanna also lends his inimitable pipes to the mix.Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬â Var, No Idea Records

THE EX-BOOGEYMEN will heal you. Those having witnessed the group's performances (or sermons, if you will) call them "Masters of Ceremony," "Messiahs of Mischief," and "Devil Rock Revivalists." Yet above all, their true mission is to reach in and exorcise a "good good" time. Reaped from out of the muggy, voodoo-sweat swamps of "Gatorville" Florida, The Ex-Boogeymen - fronted by Reverend Liaison, a gyrating preacher of unholy redemption - orchestrate a reverb-blessed Sabbath of soul... an explosive revelry of rhythm and blue... a fuzzed-out, "choir on fire" garage rock gospel of ghoulish delights! So, ladies and gentlemen... brothers and sisters of all color, sex and creed... put your hands together for your saviors... THE EX-BOOGEYMEN!

<description>
Punk rock used to be about haggard road warriors. Before all the breakdowns and flat irons, there were busted transmissions and collect calls home. The Flatliners grew up believing in the later and rejecting the former, and after seven years playing together, they're unleashing Cavalcade, their third full-length record and an epic sonic testament to the life they've chosen. Over the last four years, the Flatliners have spent almost thirty months in vans, dive bars, and concert halls across North America, Europe, and Japan, building up a dedicated following with a sound that mixes the endless fury of '90s skate punk with the nuanced, intelligent songwriting of classic post-punks like the Replacements and Hot Water Music. After releasing the ska-punk tinged Destroy to Create (Union Label Group) in 2005, the band evolved into a harsh melodic machine with 2007's The Great Awake (Fat Wreck Chords), completing their transition into a vital modern punk unit with the Cynics 7ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃâÃÂ (Fat Wreck Chords) in late 2009. For Cavalcade, the Flatliners once again teamed up with long-time producer and friend Steve Rizun, recording sporadically between tours in their hometown of Toronto over the course of 2009. Seeking to immortalize the last year of their lives on the road, the end result is easily the band's finest hour; from the thrashy immediacy of Ã¢â¬ÅThe Calming Collection" to the dub-influenced Ã¢â¬ÅHe Was A Jazzman", it's the sound of a band hitting their stride musically and finding their voice lyrically, exploring the idea of unity through disconnectedness, of positivity in uncertain times. Driving home the theme are the numerous guest appearances on the record: members of Cancer Bats, A Wilhelm Scream, Dillinger Four, The Snips, Junior Battles, Permanent Bastards, and the Expos all contributed to Cavalcade. Add to that the presence of veteran punk Fat Mike, who flew up to jam with the band in November of 2009, earning an additional production credit and making one of the band's childhood dreams come true. They've grown up on record and in front of a crowd of like-minded punks. They've made sacrifices to keep the wheels of their van on the road, and Cavalcade is the reward. It really is, as the band says, Ã¢â¬Åa call to arms to all who travel throughout the world on the wings of their creativity."

<description>
The Fucking Wrath was conceived in Montalvo, California by three long-time friends who worked in the same record store and lived on the same street. While the members had each been playing in dedicated bands for more than ten years, they initially formed T.F.W. as a result of jamming for fun after work. Since their first gig in November of 2005, they have gone on to play a continual string of sho...ws that hasen't stopped yet. The band recorded their first album, "Season Of Evil", during the week of 6/06/06. In true DIY fashion the band payed for the recording themselves. After numerous shows playing with a ride range of bands from Tragedy to Blue Cheer and High On Fire to the Adolescents their mix of punk/stoner metal/rock n roll caught the attention of Goodfellow and Challenge The Throne Records who released "Seasons..." on CD and LP respectivly in August of 2007. With rave reviews from print and online zines, the group embarked on two nation-wide tours and several west coast ventures. The Fucking Wrath Recently signed with the legendary Tee Pee Records and realeased their debut E.P. "Terra Fire" in Oct of 2010 and set out on a west coast tour with Label mates Ancestors. They are now writing for their Next fulll length LP titles "Valley of the Serpent Soul" shcedualed to come out Sept/Oct of 2011. The Fucking Wrath now averages close to 100 shows per year with no sign of slowing down. They have a track included on the Nardcore Compilation: 30 Years Later LP on Burning Tree Records. In 2009, Brent Woodward joined the group, adding a second guitar to the mix. Fueled by significant doses of THC, their songs are simultaneously heavy and fast, while cleverly infused with slower, droned-down riffs and sudden timing changes. The band's sound can be described as an amalgamation of groups such as Discharge, Black Flag, The Melvins and Kill 'em All-era Metallica. The Fucking Wrath consists of Craig Kasamis: guitar/guttural onslaught, Nick Minasian: bass/visceral ravaging, Brent Woodward: guitar/looking good, and John Crerar: really heavy drums.

<description>
There's two sides to every story, and Gainesville has more than it's fair share to answer for in terms of impact on the music world. The past two decades have seen a score of dubiously-legendary bands crawl from our miserable, swampy cesspool and claw their way into the annuls of debatable history. Whether respected or spurned, at this point it's safe to say that most "music fans" maintain a preconceived notion of what bands from Gainesville sound like. Luckily enough for the local denizens, who are usually treated to a Friday night of rehashed transplant grave-pissing, there are and have always been bands who are considerate enough to forgoe our town's overbearing legacy and craft music on their own terms. The Future Now are onesuch band. Rather than culling their influences locally, their geographic references reach cross-country to the Northwestern sounds of the early '90s and then onwards to the fertile Athens, GA scene that spawned later that same decade. With a sound that finds itself anchored by that familiar overdriven Fender guitar tone, The Future Now honor the tradition of compelling guitar rock with steadfast precision while rising above those who have come before by perfecting the three-part harmony (of particular note - as a three-piece band). As an upstart ensemble, it's difficult to predict how they will eventually fall into the vast spectrum of the musical rainbow, but with a powerful debut release like Hazy Orange Sunday and the energy and enthusiam of a still-green label, one can certainly expect a promising and prolific future.

Formed in 2008, The Great Explainer has risen to prominence among New Jersey's underground music scene. Smearing the lines between punk, hardcore and indie, The Great Explainer offers a progressive alternative to the typical punk rock fare. Look forward to dual contrasting vocals, complex yet aggressive guitar work and a powerfully locked in rhythm section.

<description>
With an illustrious career spanning 2 EPs for their own Weird Skull Enterprises and a 7 inch released on Evil Weevil Records, it is hard to doubt their influence on the world of contemporary music. They have been hailed as visionary, with some guy on last.fm going so far as to call them "good". But their artistic talents are not constrained to merely revolutionizing music. Recently added to the ever growing Red Scare Industries roster, it'll be interesting to see what 2011 has in store for these lunatics.

<description>
After releasing an especially lauded EP and touring much of 2009, Philadelphia's The Menzingers have been dubbed a "Band You Need To Know" in 2010 by Alternative Press and they have a brand new full length proving why. Chamberlain Waits may very well be the most important record released so far by Red Scare and on it The Menzingers combine many of the genre's styles (punk, hardcore, folk) to make for an undeniably infectious hybrid of hits. Produced by Matt Allison at Atlas Studios (Alkaline Trio, Less Than Jake, Lawrence Arms), this band and this new album are destined for great, great things. In 2010, the band saw the cover of AMP magazine and supported Gaslight Anthem, Against Me! NOFX, and Anti Flag throughout the US and Canada.

<description>
The Outsiders released their debut EP at their first show in July 2008. In the three years since the band has grown dramatically in cramped tour vans and on stages around the world. Following a belief that location will not hold them back the band have toured the US/Europe/UK/ Australia and New Zealand constantly. The Outsiders have supported acts such such as Nofx, Megadeth, Against Me, Strike Anywhere, Lagwagon, Propagandhi, A Death in the Family, Smoke or Fire, Dead to Me, The Flatliners and many many more. The Outsiders have played everything from squats in East Germany to major music festivals such as The Fest 9 in the USA and No Sleep Till and have been featured in AMP Magazine and on Blank TV. The Words Will Write Themselves full length was released in 2010. Mid 2011 will see the worldwide release of the bands second EP through a soon to be announced US label and extensive touring of NZ/Australia/Europe and the US will follow alongside bands such as Against Me, Off With Their Heads, Face to Face and many more.

<description>
Evolution is a natural process that can neither be forced nor contrived, but can be accelerated by constant pressure and motion. Since their inception a few short years ago, The Riot Before have kept their burners on high, maintaining a perpetual drive that propelled them almost overnight from obscurity to legendary road warrior status. From their humble, guileless beginnings, they've rapidly matured into an experienced and irrefutable force. After the virulent success of 2008's âFists Buried in Pockets," they immediately set to work forging a new record. With the help of Paper + Plastick's seemingly infinite underworld connections, the planets aligned during a full moon and they found themselves locked away in the ivory tower known as The Magpie Cage alongside fabled production wizard J Robbins (Jawbreaker, Against Me!, The Promise Ring). Together, they cast and fired their finest work to date, a sprawling composite that fuses the band's driving, melodic anthems with Robbins' dissonant, angular production. The resulting opus stands as a genre-defying testament to musical progression, as each song draws clear and differing influences while maintaining a cohesive texture throughout the course of the record. These guys are also Hella Rad.

<description>
It's rare that a band is given the opportunity to completely reinvent itself. It's rarer for a band to do it right. Welland, Ontario's The Snips have managed such a seismic shift with Blackouts (October 2010) on Drive Records/Fontana North (Canada). Formed over ten years ago in the fuck-around way that most high school bands come together, by 2007, the band (then known as The Ceremonial Snips) had managed to get it together enough to grab the attention of noted Canadian punk label, Union 2112, along with Japanese imprint In-N-Out. Their full-length debut, "Check Your Audio," took The Snips all over North America, leading them to perform over 160 times in 2008 alone. Canadian and American tours with bands like A Wilhelm Scream, Streetlight Manifesto, and Black Lungs followed, as did dates on Warped Tour and a split 7" with good friends (and fellow Ontarian punks) The Flatliners, this time on Paper+Plastick Records. But after over a decade, the band was due for a change. Outgrowing the frenetic, thrash-tinged ska-punk of Check Your Audio, the band parted ways with original vocalist Mike Podio, ditched the "Ceremonial" caveat of their name, and moved trumpet player Ricky Pridmore up into the frontman's spot. The reinvigorated band found themselves writing in a new, exciting way, using the horn talents of Pridmore and guitarist Chris Accursi to accent their songs, rather than lead them. Reaching outside the confines of melodic hardcore, the band's new songs sit somewhere between the world of fast-paced punk and thoughtful, energetic indie rock, flexing a musical muscle that would be equally at home on tour with Against Me! or Death Cab for Cutie. The result of a year spent re-writing The Snips rulebook are the six songs contained on "Blackouts," which move from the catchy, anthemic rock'n'roll of 'Tired Tires' to the heavy, Hot Snakes-inspired groove of 'Finkle is Einhorn'.

From Atlanta, GA, the WILD are a bunch of friends who love playing music and sharing in the DIY philosophy of music, art, and politics. This is what The WILD has to say about themselves... 'We are five friends having a great time playing music together... We all feel the best when we are traveling together and getting to see old friends, making new ones, jumping off of high things into water, and playing music every night. right now everybody lives all over the country.... We're from Atlanta, Lexington, Denver, Brooklyn, Toronto, Ft. Lauderdale, and Massachusetts... We write songs that are political and personal.' What pine magazine had to say about the WILD: 'The celebratory storytelling and punk-folksy delivery of this four-piece makes you wonder how such clean guitars could get your body shaking so hard. The Wild are a lot of fun, and their approach, defiant in a Bob Dylan sort of way, should give kids everywhere the feeling that they can make a difference in the world, no matter how bad things get in the interim.'

Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius-and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction." -Albert Einstein<br />
 <br />
 Dumb comes in many moods and flavors. Too Many Daves is good-dumb. We have made the following reference chart which doesn't mention any music, just movies you may have seen. * TMD is "you-mean-I'm-going-to-stay-this-color?" dumb like in Steve Martin in The Jerk, not Father of the Bride Part II stupid-fucking-bourgeois-problems-dumb. * TMD is good-drunk-nihilism-zen-dumb, like Chevy Chase in Caddy Shack, not what-the-fuck?-child-friendly-assholeishness Chevy Chase The Karate Dog dumb. * TMD is Super Troopers cops-on-weed dumb, not Starship Troopers aliens-and-Scientology dumb. * TMD is Meatballs hide-your-boner dumb, not Meatballs 4 Corey-Feldman-is-a-boner dumb. TMD is fat dudes encouraging sweaty people to kiss each other. TMD tells time by their slices. TMD burns weed, not pizza. TMD is much better than they should be. They all have Dave somewhere in their names and there are five of them.

<description>
Touche Amore are a thought provoking, passionate hardcore/punk band from Los Angeles, California. From the first strikes of their angular yet melodic chords, it's apparent that Touche Amore have awoken something long forgotten in the hardcore/punk genre. Bringing to mind the balance of rage and melody that "Revolution Summer" era DC bands Rites of Spring and Ignition once carried. Within each song they build an awe inspiring musical tension while impassioned vocalist Jeremy Bolm's shouts resonate, ripe with intellectual introspection. This collective outpouring of traditional hardcore anger and emotional hardcore openness ultimately coalesces into something beautiful, vulnerable, and refreshingly real. Shortly after their formation in late 2007, Touche Amore released their demo 7"EP on the No Sleep label. After touring the West Coast in support of that release, they recorded their debut album "...To the Beat of a Dead Horse" in early 2009. The album was co-released by the 6131 and Collect (Geoff from Thursday's vinyl only imprint) record labels, and was praised by kids and press worldwide as one of the best releases of the year. Soon after, they hit the road with a wide variety of bands including Converge, Coalesce, Thursday, Envy, and more. On the heels of these travels, Touche Amore even managed to release a number of EPs, including splits with friends La Dispute and Make Do And Mend.

<description>
Tubers. Organic creations, blooming beneath the soil while drawing nutrients from their surroundings, soon to be unearthed, cooked, and consumed by native populations. Also, Floridian slang for two populations. The first; those who float upon inflatable inner tubes in aimless, lackadaisical delight down the stateÃ¢â¬â¢s many freshwater springs. The second; those who seek adventure tucked away in the innermost furl of a wave just before it washes ashore. Finally, four long-time friends who make music for the purpose of challenging themselves and hopefully those around them. They draw inspiration from their namesakes and channel these feelings through guitars, throats, and drums. All four offer considerable musical and lyrical contributions, creating a unified and representative front that defies the traditional Ã¢â¬Åprimary songwriterÃ¢â¬Â model. Angular riffs swerve throughout the mix atop surf-influenced rhythms, with the aggressive trappings of previous efforts remaining apparent but not overbearing. They speak in dialects and metaphors, fluctuating seamlessly amongst obtuse structures, shifting momentums, and rolling cascades.

<description>
Vacation Bible School is a pop punk three piece whose home base lies somewhere in the Chicago-ish region of north eastern Illinois. John, Ryan, and Sean are three guys in their early thirties, who act like guys in their early twenties, and those who know them will confirm this. They are currently stoked to be releasing their newest full length lp, "Vacation Bible School Ruined the Scene" on Underground Communique records this summer. It's full of good old fashioned self deprecating, and catchy tunes that ask the important questions like "why me?", and "really?".

We're from Southern California. We're kind of old. We don't like surfing that much or plastic surgery. Skateboarding is pretty fun though. Our history: Our demo came out in 2007. Our EP "Dirt Hearts" came out in 2008. So did our other EP "The Healers". 2009 we recorded our full length "Savages". 2010, it came out on Red Scare Industries. We're still pretty happy about that. We WILL be doing a 7" or two in 2011 and will definitely start writing a new record as well. We play a lot in Southern California and kind of hate it. We've only played in the east coast 2 times. Both of those times were at The Fest.

<description>
The members of Wavelets met each other in 1992 when they all competed against each other in the 4th Division Toddler level Scrabble Quarterfinals. They would later find out, through advances in DNA testing in 1999, that they were all born of the same father. Bonding over a shared love of breakfast cereals, the quintet grew up to become an unstoppable force in the burgeoning XVX Twinklers scene. Originally intended to be a Spazz cover band, the five brothers finally gave into label pressure to write original material, which could be described as Colossal meets Weatherbox with a total disregard for choruses. The band is probably most notable for guitar player Luke Moses who, after growing bored of playing guitar left handed as God intended, retrained himself to play right handed. The band has begrudgingly upstaged screamo legends My Heart To Joy every time they have played in Gainesville. All the members play instruments.

Unhappy with the current state of ska music, We Are The Union decided to stick out their own necks and tried to change things for the better in the summer of 2005. Getting a paycheck is not on their agenda. Instead of following typical ska punk conventions, WATU takes a harder-nosed approach to the genre. With influences ranging from Philadelphia/New Jersey favorites Lifetime and Kid Dynamite, and bands like Slapstick and This Is A Standoff, they rage with the best of them while still retaining a heightened sense of melody. Their love for fast music, horns and their incredibly short attention spans are a simple explanation for why WATU sound the way they do. Over the past two and a half years, they have also been incredibly hardworking. With nearly a dozen tours in the US and UK under their belt in this short span of time, theyâve now thrown caution to the wind and continue to be on the road full time. This will surely add to the list of heavy hitters theyâve shared the stage with that includes The Suicide Machines, Shook Ones, Mustard Plug, Set Your Goals, The Flatliners, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Make Do And Mend, Spring Heeled Jack, Bomb! The Music Industry, The Aquabats, Four Year Strong, Such Gold, Fireworks, Hostage Calm, Transit, The Wonder Years, The Swellers, A Loss For Words, and Hellmouth. Their work ethic cannot just be applied to their tours either. Their first full-length âWho We Areâ, self-released in the summer of 2007, was given away for free by the band via the Internet. Their generosity was met with a rapidly surging fan base and an offer to have the record released in Japan via InYaFace Records. Their expectations for the band are simple. They want to keep making music they love while touring relentlessly in order to provide people with a positive environment for fun and the venting of frustration. Paper + Plastick saw the youthful exuberance and the amount of integrity this young bunch of punks had and quickly wanted to become involved. 2010 brought the release of âGreat Leaps Forwardsâ, the Billy Bragg-inspired new full length from We Are The Union. Already outselling their previous releases, WATU hit Canada and the US in support of âGreat Leaps Forwardâ with Strung Out (Fat Wreck Chords) and Rufio in August and September before heading to the UK for dates with Less Than Jake and Zebrahead in November. The band spent the first quarter of 2011 writing and recording an EP at Drasik Studios in Chicago, IL for a summer release on Paper + Plastick records. In April of 2011, shortly after they finished tracking, they hit the eastern US with The Forthrights, The Fad, Green Room Rockers, Stuck Lucky and The Brunt Of It on the Ska Is Dead Presents: Young Guns tour. The band will spend June and July on a full-US co-headlining tour with New Jersey pop-punk band I Call Fives, featuring support from Handguns and The Story So Far.

The Great B-Ball Purge of 2041, a day so painful to some that it is referred to only as the "B-Ballnacht". Thousands upon thousands of the world's greatest ballers were massacred in a swath of violence and sports bigotry as the game was outlawed worldwide. The reason: the Chaos Dunk, a jam so powerful its mere existence threatens the balance of chaos and order. Among the few ballers and fans that survived the basketball genocide were WE WERE SKELETONS, the men capable of performing the "Verboten Jam"... Flash forward 12 years to the post-cyberpocalyptic ruins of Neo New York, 2053. A Chaos Dunk rocks the island of Manhattan, killing 15 million. When the finger is put on the aging WE WERE SKELETONS, they must evade the capture of the B-Ball Removal Department, led by former friend and baller Michael Jordan, and disappear into the dangerous underground of the post-cyberpocalypse to clear their name and find out the mysterious truth behind the Chaos Dunk. Joined by allies along the way, including the bassist's son Hoopz, WE WERE SKELETONS must face the dangers of a life they thought he gave up a long time ago and discover the secrets behind the terrorist organization B.L.O.O.D.M.O.S.E.S. [3 piece hardcore band from Lancaster, PA that wants to sound like Shotmaker, Four Hundred Years, Sleepytime Trio, and, I dunno, Off Minor.]

Worn In Red hail from the long-standing promised land of thick, blistering hardcore; Virginia. They share hometowns in both Richmond and Charlottesville, drinking deep from a rich history of since-fallen bands like Sleepytime Trio, Hoover, Four Hundred Years, Maximillian Colby, Action Patrol, and Frodus, while also paying tribute to contemporary titans Planes Mistaken For Stars, Glass and Ashes, and Hot Water Music. The '0s were rife with talented, passionate, and engaging bands who built upon the legacies of their forebearers while pushing the envelope as far as they could, crafting a myriad of fresh and provoking sounds. One of the epicenters was Virginia, former home of the Confederacy and lately a crucible of pluralism. A land where urban uproots rural and tradition trades blows with progress, forging a cultural battleground strewn with ideological rubble. It was here that the gentlemen of Worn In Red came of age, bearing witness to a generation of bands who now live on only in record store lore, all of whom left a lasting impression on the few who were there when it happened. Worn In Red draw on the elements these bands held most dear; a fiercly independent ethic that celebrates the power and capability we all hold, a desperation and darkness brought on by the constant personal struggle with society, and an unflinchingly honest approach to musical and artistic expression. With ideals intact, they unleash their aggression in a hail of gutted screams, churning rhythms, and triumpantly soaring melodies. "Considering how nice these guys are, they sure do yell a lot. They feel like family. Their songs gnawed their way into my brain over the last year, and being involved in this record was not an option: it became an imperative. Heavy and pummeling locks in with a melodic, open groove. Duality in tandem. Good hair too." - Var
