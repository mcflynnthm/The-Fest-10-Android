#summary Features to be added

= Features to be Added =

Here's where the wish list of features to be added will be. Not everything will make it into the app, but here, we can dream.


== Base App ==

  * Rethinking of how to process updates to the XML schedule
    ** See 'Issues' for more on this
  * Streaming MP3s from the Fest site
  * Settings screen
    ** Let users select when and if the app will automatically check for updates; mostly this is for people coming from outside the US who might not want to have their phone doing big data transfers when Roaming/not on WiFi. This setting will pretty much apply to all network traffic; turning off data services in the app will kill band pictures, the map, and schedule updates, pretty much.

== Neat-o whiz-bang type things ==

  * Sharing schedules with friends
    ** for Android 4.0+, NFC-based transfers?
